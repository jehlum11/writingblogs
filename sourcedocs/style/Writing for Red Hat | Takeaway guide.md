# **Content marketing** {#content-marketing}

What are audiences looking for from Red Hat’s content?

* Fresh ideas and new perspectives  
* Balanced, timely view of industry issues  
* Credible evidence and data

Content marketing focuses on creating material of value in the customer’s eyes (**not** your organization’s).

Content marketing creates a **trusted relationship** by giving your audience what they want: information. 

**Thought leadership** content generally focuses on providing information, rather than promoting products. This is a key aspect of content marketing that builds **credibility** with Red Hat's audiences. Thought leadership content is often used in the early stages of interacting with potential customers and may be a person's first interaction with a brand.

Trust combined with expertise creates credibility. At Red Hat, we can provide credible, engaging content to our audiences by:

* Taking a “show, don’t tell” approach.  
* Stating our perspective or stance on industry trends.  
* Backing up our claims with relevant, data-based proof.  
* Being consistent with our brand values.

#  **Red Hat’s content strategy** {#red-hat’s-content-strategy}

When you’re writing, **voice** is more about what you say, and **tone** is more about the attitude you use to say it. Your voice is more about you, but your tone is about your readers and how they feel.

## **Voice**

Our voice represents our brand creative platform’s foundational personality and values. It stays the same across audiences, mediums, and messages. Within this platform, we embrace the “innocent outlaw” archetype. That means balancing a child-like curiosity with bravery and leadership.

* We’re **experienced** but not **perfectionist**.

  * We speak **confidently** because we know what we’re doing. But even with our long-established expertise, we recognize we’ll never know everything. So while we know our stuff, we’re not a know-it-all.

  * Plus, technical information is complicated. That’s why we purposefully **avoid not only tech jargon, but tech marketing jargon,** too. This helps us speak confidently in a way that also creates psychologically safe spaces for our audience to ask questions and make suggestions.

* We’re **compassionate** but not **acquiescent**.

  * We **make our audience feel seen** because we’ve been them—we are them. That’s how we know wholeheartedly that their day-to-day is stifled with complexity, and why they can always expect empathy, humility, and transparency from us. 

  * We also show up. The hard stuff is kind of our thing—and so is **asking questions, challenging norms, and problem solving** alongside our customers and partners so they never face the risk of going it alone. 

* We’re **radical** but not **audacious**.

  * We **lead by example**, cutting through the nonsense with bravery and honesty. Because while our industry prefers to focus on a mostly unachievable state of simplicity, we built our company upon a commitment to doing whatever it takes today to make tomorrow a little easier. 

  * We believe in a purpose greater than ourselves, so we **challenge the status quo**―not because we want to be right, but because we want to be better.

## **Tone**

While our tone has a foundational theme or approach, it adapts based on the audience, topic, and medium to communicate more effectively. We know how to read the room because we’ve been in the room, too. The Red Hat tone is conversational, clear, and intuitive. We’re plainspoken and natural when communicating information, and know when to add (or avoid) wit or earnestness. 

We determine this by considering: 

1. The message we’re conveying.  
2. Our audience, including their state of mind and how we’d like them to feel after reading our words.

Then, we adjust our tone accordingly—but in a consistent way across different audiences, content types, mediums, channels, and more. We should maintain the conversational, plainspoken, and informative qualities of our brand tone no matter what. (In other words, just because we’re writing a financial services whitepaper with a slightly more formal tone doesn’t mean we should start throwing in an “accelerate innovation” here or a “maximize efficiencies” there.)

## **Reaching Red Hat’s audiences**

When you start a new content project, determine answers to the following questions:

1. **Who is this content for?**

   1. [Audience personas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QXGyiuYcbzVCbqSSbSxVOE_-pGdEdArHEsp-fTgjEno/edit?pli=1#bookmark=id.ouwhmdpv0ykp) generated by the [Brand and Audience Insights](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/audience_insights) team

2. **Where is your audience in the buyer or user journey?**

   1. Buyer’s journey: Education → Solution → Vendor selection

   2. [User journey](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/connected_experiences): Discover → Learn → Evaluate → Adopt → Expand

3. **What do you want your audience to do?**

   1. Considering what will be most valuable to your audience. What will they take away from your content? What would be the most valuable way for them (given their role, business challenges, stage in the buyer or user journey, etc.) to interact with Red Hat next?

## **Using acronyms without context**

* Spell out all terms on first use, followed by the acronym in parentheses. For example: command-line interface (CLI).

* Exceptions: Graphics, space-constrained mediums, or acronyms that are part of product names

* For additional guidance on these cases, refer to the [Red Hat official product list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLS_lS3VKidgZIvcLmLp9BoiqptkvqHWfe1D5FD2kfk/edit?usp=sharing) and the [corporate style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI2wHjF-9uPEo7Dnt-nugQXuIMQUgTQv_QOUXL1x8zE/edit?usp=sharing). (You may also want to check out the [Red Hat Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms Dictionary](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/red-hat-dictionary-or-lexicon) if you’re having difficulty deciphering a term.)

## **Using incorrect, outdated, or unapproved product names**

* Approved offering names are documented in the [official Red Hat product names list](https://docs.google.com/a/redhat.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR8NmHTV_TmL0dI6r8NsstV52kJDhkfJ55L3vvceAhsDVzi8QHXO3jL3Pf_H_mykX7qtBYzvY-ttZ4_/pubhtml?gid=1259317633&single=true), a resource that includes the full name, a brief description, and a list of any approved and unapproved short names and acronyms.

* Product, service, and solution names (offerings with SKUs, or stock keeping units, and are sold independently) are capitalized, except for joining words like for, and, or with. Example: “Red Hat Enterprise Linux® with Smart Management”

* Do not use “the” before product names. Example: Do not use “the Red Hat OpenStack Platform”—just say "Red Hat OpenStack Platform".

* Use the full product, service, or solution name on first use. Some products have an approved short name or acronym you can use thereafter. (Avoid using unapproved product-name acronyms.) Example: "Red Hat JBoss® Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) is a middleware platform. JBoss EAP offers middleware capabilities ..."

* Version numbers: Use whole numbers, unless what you’re saying applies only to a minor version/release.

* Component or feature names are not capitalized (with some exceptions, usually for Red Hat OpenShift components).

## **Relying on jargon to tell your story**

* Avoid business jargon and buzzwords whenever possible. Use the [corporate style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1UI2wHjF-9uPEo7Dnt-nugQXuIMQUgTQv_QOUXL1x8zE/edit) for alternatives and guidance.

## **Using outdated sources—or not citing your sources**

* Citations are required when you quote from any other source (a person, a company, an organization), paraphrase a substantial amount of material from any other source, or use research to develop your written material, etc.

* Whenever possible, **cite a primary source** (the original creator of the information), rather than a secondary source (a resource that uses others’ information and data to support their own claims and positions, such as a Wikipedia page). 

* Use the [citation style guide](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19Pz7JPc_nbbUlXSs4wOto4HNh8_LQHT6) to format citation footnotes correctly.

* In general, sources should be **no older than 2 years**, unless being cited for historical purposes (such as a blog post for an early product release).

* **Analyst sources:** Analyst sources vary, but most can only be used for 12-18 months after they are created. For analyst materials—or content that quotes or cites analysts—the Red Hat stakeholder needs to get approval from the Industry Analyst Relations team before content can be edited. They should follow the guidance on the internal [Source page](https://source.redhat.com/departments/marketing/brand_experience_and_communications/industry_analyst_relations) and/or email [analyst-relations@redhat.com](mailto:analyst-relations@redhat.com) to submit requests.

* **Customer references:** For customer materials—or content that quotes or cites customers, including logo use—the Red Hat stakeholder needs to get approval from the Customer Reference/Innovators in the Open team before content can be edited. They should follow the guidance on the internal [Source page](https://source.redhat.com/departments/marketing/customer_reference) and/or email [customer-references@redhat.com](mailto:customer-references@redhat.com) to submit requests. 

* Do not link to direct downloads: Linking directly to a file, such as a PDF, can begin a download on a reader’s computer without their awareness or consent. Additionally, direct download links can trigger email spam filters.

* Remember, just because something has been approved for use by Red Hat in one instance does *not* mean that it's been approved for use in all instances. Many of our contracts specify exactly how and when their material may be used.

## **Crafting long, overly complex sentences**

Crafting simpler sentences can help reduce the effort required (cognitive load) for even skilled readers to engage with our content.

* Avoid filler words: Adjectives like “very”, “basically”, “slightly”, as well as phases like “in order to” take up extra space without adding value to your content. 

  * [50 Filler Words List to Cut From Your Writing: Make Your Writing Stronger (Become a Writer Today)](https://becomeawritertoday.com/filler-words/)  
  * [What Are Filler Words? When You Should—And Shouldn’t—Avoid Them (Thesaurus.com)](http://Thesaurus.com)  
  * [What Are Filler Words, and How Do You Cut Them? (Grammarly)](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-we-use-filler-words/)

* Use active voice: In addition to being more engaging to audiences, using active voice instead of passive voice can both apply Red Hat’s brand characteristics within your writing and save your audience time and energy.

  * [Active Versus Passive Voice (Purdue Online Writing Lab (OWL))](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/active_and_passive_voice/active_versus_passive_voice.html)

  * [Active vs. Passive Voice (Grammarly)](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/active-vs-passive-voice/)

* Think: one sentence, one idea.: If you find your sentences getting too long or complex—more than 1-2 lines—break them up. 

  * Separate each point or idea into its own sentence. (Sorry, fellow em dash lovers\!)

  * If your run-on sentence contains a series or list, consider adding a bulleted list to improve readability. Even small improvements can add up in longer content.

* Stick to word and character limits: 

  * Publication media, such as social media platforms and search engines, often provide word and character limits for titles, post or description content, links, and more. Any content past these limits will either prevent you from publishing, or be cut off. 

  * Our content teams also provide character counts for other content, such as titles of web pages or collateral assets. 

## **Capitalizing the wrong (or too many) words**

* Use sentence case (not Title Case) for all titles, headers, etc. 

* We do not capitalize concepts or other non-proper nouns (such as hybrid cloud, generative AI, artificial intelligence, etc.)

# **Tips and tricks** {#tips-and-tricks}

## **Think about context now … because later, your content might not have any.**

Ask yourself:

* Could what I’m saying be **offensive**? Does it include language or sentiments that could be perceived as racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory?  
* Will my message **make sense** outside of the original, intended context?  
* Am I representing Red Hat’s brand in a **positive, useful way**?

## **Apply the 5 Cs**

* **Be clear:** Be as specific as possible; vague language can confuse your audiences. In addition to avoiding jargon, use active voice and include any necessary information to get your point across. 

* **Be concise:** Balance providing the right amount of detail with getting to your point. Our audiences’ time is limited, and we don’t want them to lose interest or become frustrated with long, convoluted sentences and unnecessary words.

* **Be compelling:** Instead of listing facts and figures, create a narrative. Bring your audience along for a journey, from starting with the challenges they face to proposing Red Hat solutions to sharing the benefits they can achieve if they take that path. Show, don’t tell. 

* **Be confident:** Don’t be afraid to take a stance, whether you’re directly comparing Red Hat to a competitor (within our competitive content guidelines) or simply asserting the powerful benefits we help our customers achieve. Don’t forget our brand values, though\!

* **Be credible:** As discussed in earlier sections, proof helps build trust and credibility with our audiences. Provide relevant, data-based evidence for your claims—and cite your sources.
