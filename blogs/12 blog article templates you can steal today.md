# **12 blog article templates you can steal today**

If you want to write for the Red Hat Blog but you're not sure how to get started, you're in the right place. We've put together example outlines for 12 different types of blog articles, from listicles and opinion pieces to technical deep dives and historical perspectives.

Of course these are all just suggestions and examples \-- they won't necessarily fit the topic you're writing about, and you're welcome to use, modify or ignore whatever you want. You can even take pieces from different article types and create your own mashup. Our goal is to help you write engaging articles that serve our readers' needs.

***Full disclosure***: We used chatGPT to help create the initial drafts of these outlines, and we'll continue refining them over time. If you have any suggestions or questions, please feel free to send us a note at [editorial-team@redhat.com](mailto:editorial-team@redhat.com).
