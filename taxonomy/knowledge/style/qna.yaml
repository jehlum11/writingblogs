  The document goes over guidelines and best practices for different content
  types when writing for Red Hat. It highlights the content strategy, voice,
  types of content employees can put out, as well as what not to do when writing
  something.
seed_examples:
  - context: >-
      When publishing content on behalf of Red Hat, authors should focus on what
      the customers want to hear - they should highlight important information,
      ideas, perspectives with trusted data, rather than just promote a
      product.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are audiences looking for when they're consuming Red Hat content?
        answer: >-
          Audiences, both current customers and prospective customers, are
          looking for honest information, presented in a creative and engaging
          manner. They want content that provides value to them with new ideas,
          a balanced view of industry trends, and credibility, rather than a
          piece of content that is just trying to sell a product.
      - question: 'How can authors provide good content? '
        answer: >-
          Show audiences what your product can do, rather than just telling
          them. For example, a piece that goes over the steps needed to install
          Red Hat OpenShift on AWS can be more valuable than a piece that just
          tells users that Red Hat OpenShift can be installed on AWS. Authors
          can use screenshots, demos etc. to illustrate this further, as well as
          assure users that this is based on factual data.
      - question: What is the tone of voice when putting out a piece?
        answer: >-
          Follow the Red Hat brand values - be open, honest, use correct product
          names, cite sources.
  - context: >-
      Red Hat's content strategy reflects the brand value. Voice and tone are
      important - it is about what the author says and how it makes the readers
      feel. Authors should consider what is most valuable to their audience and
      what they will take away from the piece.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the Red Hat voice?
        answer: >-
          It is important to be confident and experienced, while being humble.
          Authors should avoid jargon - be compassionate  and try to meet
          audiences where they are.
      - question: Why is tone important?
        answer: >-
          Tone can be changed based on the intended audience, medium and topic.
          Be conversational, clear and intuitive. Avoid jargon, try to
          communicate information clearly.
      - question: How does the tone vary based on audiences or types of content?
        answer: >-
          With a blog for an experienced user or an advanced customer, the tone
          can be causal, demonstrative and informal. When writing an informative
          thought leadership blog, the tone can be illustrative, explain more
          about the product. When writing a white paper, the tone can be
          formal.
  - context: >-
      When writing content, authors should try not to use a lot of jargon,
      acronyms without context. We can't expect users to know how we talk.
      Authors shouldn't use incorrect or outdated product names. The content
      should be written in a simple, clear manner - a blog should not be verbose
      just for the sake of verbosity. We should cite our sources.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What are examples of some content best practices when naming tools or
          products?
        answer: >-
          Authors should provide proper context and be illustrative. All terms
          and products should be spelled out upon first usage so that users are
          on the same page as the author.
      - question: How can an author cite sources?
        answer: >-
          Citations are important whenever using a quote from another source -
          be it a company, person etc. Cite recent sources - old data is not
          helpful. For customer materials, be very careful and try to get
          approval.
      - question: What are some writing best practices?
        answer: >-
          Simpler, engaging sentences are key. Active use is more helpful and
          don't be unnecessarily  verbose. Invite users to engage.
  - context: >-
      The 5Cs of content are important - authors should be clear, concise,
      compelling, confident, and credible.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How can an author be clear and concise?
        answer: >-
          Vague information can be confusing - jargon should be avoided, and the
          piece should get right to the point. We should honor users' time and
          include all necessary information that they need to know.
      - question: How can an author be engaging?
        answer: >-
          An author should be compelling and confident. Authors should create a
          narrative, present an engaging idea to bring users along, and
          confidently state accurate facts.
      - question: How can an author back up facts?
        answer: >-
          Citations are important since it helps build trust and credibility
          with our users. Users need to know they trust Red Hat. Cite sources
          and provide relevant evidence.
  - context: >-
      When starting a new project, authors should think about who the content is
      for, what the user's problems are and what the user will find the most
      valuable.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          How can authors determine what content they can put out for
          prospective customers who are not yet using the product?
        answer: >-
          Authors should think about where their audience is in the buyer's
          journey if they are a prospective buyer. A buyer's journey goes over
          educating themselves about the options in the market, finding the best
          solution, and select it.
      - question: 'What is the user''s journey? '
        answer: >-
          For an existing user, think about whether they want to discover what
          the product does, learn how to solve a problem, evaluate what they are
          doing and if it fits their need, start adopting the product and its
          features, and if they like it, use more of the product.
      - question: 'How can author put out the most valuable piece? '
        answer: >-
          Authors should try to put the audience first and provide information
          that will be useful to them.
