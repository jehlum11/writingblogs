  These skills give examples on how to write catchy titles for blogs for Red
  Hat.
seed_examples:
  - context: >-
      Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 7 is going to be end of life soon,
      so Red Hat will not be supporting it anymore. We want customers using RHEL
      7 to upgrade to RHEL version 8 or above. We have automated this upgrade
      process to help. The title should be catchy and convey all information
      clearly.
    question: >-
      I am writing a 'how-to' blog about automating upgrades for RHEL 7. What
      would be a good title for it?
    answer: '''How to automate upgrades before RHEL 7 end of maintenance?'''
  - context: >-
      Tekton and Jenkins are CI/CD tools. Jenkins is older, more suitable for
      monolithic, Java applications. Tekton is cloud-native and more suited for
      micro services applications. Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines, a CI/CD tool, is
      also based on the Tekton project. The blog will be a technical comparison
      of the two tools, in the context  of Red Hat OpenShift. The title should
      capture all crucial information about the tools, product and what they do,
      as well as an insight into the blog.
    question: >-
      I am writing a blog that compares two CI/CD tools called Tekton and
      Jenkins, based on their technical attributes. How do I title it?
    answer: >-
      'Tekton vs. Jenkins: What's better for CI/CD pipelines on Red Hat
      OpenShift?'

      For a thought leadership blog, readers can be both technical and business
      personas. A thought leadership blog typically explains the technology and
      goes over how the prospective and existing customer, i.e. readers of the
      blog can use this technology to build new applications and partner with
      Red Hat for it. The title should be intriguing and invite people to learn
      more.
    question: >-
      I want to write thought leadership blogs about AI/ML and generative AI.
      Can you give me ideas on topics?
    answer: >-
      'What is AI/ML and why does it matter to your business?', 'Generative AI:
      How it can be applied to business applications today'
  - context: >-
      InstructLab is an upstream open-source project that aims to democratize AI
      development, specifically generative AI development. InstructLab wants to
      provide everyone the ability to contribute and customize models. The title
      of the blog should be concise and interesting to draw people to read the
      blog.
    question: >-
      I want to write a blog that encourages people to try out and contribute to
      an upstream project called InstructLab. Can you give me an idea for a
      topic?
    answer: '''How the InstructLab project is working to advance AI efforts'''
  - context: >-
      Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI) is based on the open source project,
      InstructLab, and combines novel data generation and fine-tuning
      methodologies. A business benefit-focused blog would cover the values of
      using RHEL AI and open source technologies for AI development. The title
      will need to be concise and clear. A deep dive will need to be focused on
      the technical users, like data scientists or developers, and the title
      will have to reflect the more technical nature of it.
    question: >-
      I am working on a product called RHEL AI. I want to write a blog series
      that covers the business-level benefit of RHEL AI as well as a deep dive
      into how the product. Can you give me ideas for this?
    answer: >-
      Here are some ideas: 'What is RHEL AI? A guide to the open source way for
      doing AI' for business benefits. 'How to build custom models with RHEL AI
      in 5 steps' for a more technical audience.
