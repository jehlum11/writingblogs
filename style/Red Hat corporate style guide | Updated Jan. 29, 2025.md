| A note about inclusive language:  Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. For more information on the purpose of this work, see [CTO Chris Wright's message](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language). Refer to added style guide entries for: inclusive language, Black, blacklist, and master/slave for usage details. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually and guidance (including what constitutes acceptable versus unacceptable use) will evolve over time.  For more information about how these changes take place, contact the [Conscious Language Working Group](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AkmBjeKV6cWka1ezdgGhgd2sSXNNCbVjWIcsTqlx9n0/edit?usp=sharing). |

  # **‚Äî** {#‚Äî}

  See [em dash](#em-dash-\(‚Äî\))*.*


  # **&, \+** {#&,-+}

  When space is available, the preference is to use the word ‚Äúand.‚Äù When space is constrained or in design elements and graphics, use the ampersand, not the plus sign. Design elements and space-constrained places include:

* Tab labels.

* Headlines and headings.

* Certain parts of navigation (menu labels, tabs, CTA buttons, column headings).

* Social media posts (namely Twitter) with limited characters.

* Images.

* Email subject lines (BUT NOT the body of the email).

  When quoting third-party content, match the content as it appears in the source. If using an ampersand within a series in a headline or heading, place a comma before the ampersand (just as you would with "and"). Example in context: Transform, optimize, & protect.

  üõà **Note:** Regarding content that will be translated, keep in mind that in some languages, the ampersand is not considered "correct" (though it may be understood).

  Refer to the [Fonts and typography: Punctuation](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards/typography#punctuation) section of the Brand Standards for more information.

  See [ampersand](#ampersand).


  # **\!**

  See [exclamation points](#exclamation-points-\(!\)).


  # **/**

  Avoid using a forward slash to replace "and" or "or" (for example, I have to meet him/her). 

  See also [and/or](#and/or), [price/performance](#price/performance).


  # **%**

  See [percent](#percent-\(%\)).

  # **24x7, 24x7x365**

  Use "24x7" in most instances. Use "24x7x365" only when we want to differentiate Red Hat from others or highlight specifically that we offer a service every day of the year, such as providing 24x7x365 phone support. 

  See also [time](#time).


  # **2-track (IT)(adj.)** {#2-track-(it)(adj.)}

  Less common way to refer to bimodal IT; do not use. 

  See also [bimodal IT](#bimodal-it).


  # **3D (n. or adj.)**


  # **64-bit ARM (n.)** {#64-bit-arm-(n.)}

  A 64-bit version of the ARM architecture. This term can refer to both AArch66/aarch64 and ARM64/arm64.

  Use this format in general cases when writing for both names of the architecture and various cloud providers.

  Cloud providers can use different formats of this term when using architectures. If you are documenting code, commands, or outputs, confer with your subject matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

  Examples: 

* The customer is using Amazon Web Services (AWS) on 64-bit ARM systems.

* The customer is using multiple machine types for Microsoft Azure on 64-bit ARM infrastructures.

  See also [Aarch64, aarch64 (n.)](#aarch64,-aarch64-\(n.\)); [AMD64, amd64](#amd64,-amd64); [ARM64, arm64](#arm64,-arm64); [Intel 64](#intel-64-\(n.\)); [x86\_64](#x86_64); [64-bit x86](#64-bit-x86-\(n.\)).


  # **64-bit x86 (n.)** {#64-bit-x86-(n.)}

  A 64-bit version of the x86 architecture. This term can refer to x86\_64, Intel 64, and AMD64. Use this format in general cases when writing for both names of the architectures for various cloud providers.

  Cloud providers can use different formats of this term when using architectures. If you are documenting code, commands or outputs, confer with your subject matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

  Examples: 

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) on 64-bit x86 systems

* Machine types for Microsoft Azure on 64-bit x86 infrastructures

  See also [Aarch64, aarch64 (n.)](#aarch64,-aarch64-\(n.\)); [AMD64, amd64](#amd64,-amd64); [ARM64, arm64](#arm64,-arm64); [Intel 64](#intel-64-\(n.\)); [x86\_64](#x86_64); [64-bit ARM](#64-bit-arm-\(n.\)).


  

| [Back to top](#bookmark=id.wrqnzzq6cgua) |

  # **AArch64, aarch64 (n.)** {#aarch64,-aarch64-(n.)}

  A 64-bit version of the ARM architecture. Use this term when referring to operating systems and server instances, for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, CoreOS, and other Linux distributions.

  Use the uppercase (AArch64) format in general cases when referring to system architecture. Use the lowercase (aarch64) format ONLY when referring to objects or parameters. It may be styled as code (monospace font or a code-styled block) when referring to code.

  Cloud providers can use different formats of this term when using architectures. If you are documenting code, commands, or outputs, confer with your subject-matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

  Examples:

* When running Red Hat Enterprise Linux with an AArch64 system, run the following commands:

* Specify the system architecture of your cluster, such as x86\_64 or aarch64.

  See also [AMD64, amd64](#amd64,-amd64); [ARM64, arm64](#arm64,-arm64); [Intel 64](#intel-64-\(n.\)); [x86\_64](#x86_64); [64-bit x86](#64-bit-x86-\(n.\)); [64-bit ARM](#64-bit-arm-\(n.\)).


  # **abbreviations**

  See [acronyms & abbreviations](#acronyms-&-abbreviations).


  # **abort**

  Use only if the term is part of the existing product terminology; for example, a command option or a button label. In all other instances, replace with "cancel," "stop," "end," or "fail."


  # **above**

  Do not use to refer to information mentioned previously. When documents are converted to HTML or laid out in a print template, the information may no longer actually be "above."


  # **absolute, comparative, and superlative words**

  We avoid using absolute and superlative words, as they are not accurate, often subjective and unnecessary, and put Red Hat at legal risk. Many countries have legal restrictions against making promises using absolutes to make claims that cannot be substantiated. To use words like "leading", "leader", "top", "first", "100%", "most", and "only", you must have a citation that proves the claim. We avoid any statement or representation that could mislead customers, including using exaggerations and ambiguities.

* Additional examples of absolute words to avoid: "all", "any", "every".

* Additional examples of superlative words to avoid: "best", "quickest", "fastest".

  When using comparative words (e.g., "quicker", "faster", "easier", "higher"), proper context is needed. Be specific about the improvements in process or practice that we can bring and how we deliver those improvements.

* Example of what to avoid: Red Hat¬Æ Cloud Services are the easiest, most cost-effective way to deliver cloud-native applications.

* Better approach: Red Hat¬Æ Cloud Services include hosted and managed platform, application, and data services that streamline the hybrid cloud experience, reducing the operational cost and complexity of delivering cloud-native applications.


  # **acronyms & abbreviations** {#acronyms-&-abbreviations}

* Expand all acronyms and abbreviations on first use. Spell out acronyms or initialisms before using them in text (for example, "Embedded DevKit (EDK)"), unless the acronym or initialism stands for a proper noun, then use sentence case for the spelled-out version (for example, "central processing unit (CPU)").

* Avoid using acronyms and abbreviations for product names. Refer to products by full name, as shown in the official Red Hat product and solution names list (Google doc). Do not use product acronyms in formal communications.

* Consult the [Red Hat Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Initialisms Dictionary](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/red-hat-dictionary-or-lexicon) as needed.

* In Slack, use Go Bot to look up acronyms. (This tool replaces the Acrobot tool used in Google Chat.) 

  * To use, type a period or exclamation point followed by the acronym‚Äïfor example, ‚Äú.OCP‚Äù or ‚Äú\!OCP‚Äù‚Äïand post.

  * Note: This tool works for channels where Go Bot has been added. To invite Go Bot to a channel, post ‚Äú@gobot‚Äù and follow the provided instructions.

  **Exceptions:**

  There are cases where acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable. These include:

* After the first use in technical, customer-facing documentation. Examples:

  * Getting started guides.

  * Install guides.

  * Documentation on the Customer Portal.

  * Knowledgebase solutions and articles.

  * Bugzilla entries.

  * Support case summaries or details.

  * Other subscription materials and resources.

  * Training materials.

* When space is physically limited, such as:

  * Very small web or print ads.

  * Social media with a character or display limit (such as X (formerly Twitter), Instagram).

* Products where the abbreviation or acronym is part of the official product name, including Red Hat AMQ. (In these cases, the abbreviation is more well-known than its expansion.)

  Always ensure that the acronyms or abbreviations you use will not be confusing or conflict with other offerings or common terms. To form the plural of an acronym, add a trailing, lowercase "s" with no apostrophe. For example, ROMs, PINs, BIOSs.

  üõà Exception: Technical documentation uses "es" in some cases, for example, BIOSes, OSes, and similar terms.


  # **actionable (adj.)**

  Traditionally, a legal term. In business it's used to mean either "acting on something" or "useful," as with data or intelligence. It has become overused and is considered by many to be jargon. Instead, try "take action," "lets you take action," or "useful."


  # **administrivia (n.)**

  Not a word. Do not use.


  # **adviser**

  Per AP Stylebook, use adviser, not advisor.


  # **affect** {#affect}

  When you affect something, it produces an effect.


  # **agile, agile development**

  A general term for several like types of development practices and processes (lightweight, waterfall, etc.). It is not a proper noun, nor is it owned or trademarked and should not be capitalized.


  # **alternate**

  Do not use this to mean ‚Äúan alternative to something. "Alternate" is a verb that means to change between two states or options. As an adjective, it means every second (alternating) thing in a series. If you mean "another way or option," use "alternative."


  # **ampersand** {#ampersand}

  See [&, \+](#&,-+).


  # **AM and PM**

  Uppercase with no periods after letters or space between them. See also [time](#time).


  # **AMD64, amd64** {#amd64,-amd64}

  The AMD 64-bit version of the x86 architecture. Use this term for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform attributes, Kubernetes, operators, application programming interfaces (APIs), or command-line interface (CLI) objects. 

  Use the uppercase format (AMD64) in general sentences when referring to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform features. Use the lowercase format (amd64) ONLY when referring to objects or parameters. It may be styled as code (monospace font or a code-styled block) when referring to code.

  Cloud providers can use different formats of this term when using architectures. If you are documenting code, commands, or outputs, confer with your subject matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

  Examples:

* This operator is supported on AMD64 and ARM64 platforms.

* In this scenario, amd64 is a valid value for X.

  See also [Aarch64, aarch64](#aarch64,-aarch64-\(n.\)); [ARM64, arm64](#arm64,-arm64); [Intel 64](#intel-64-\(n.\)); [x86\_64](#x86_64); [64-bit x86](#64-bit-x86-\(n.\)); [64-bit ARM](#64-bit-arm-\(n.\)).


  # **and/or** {#and/or}

  Avoid if possible. One or the other nearly always conveys the real meaning. If it doesn't, try a structure like, "Have some bacon, eggs, or both."


  # **applications**

  When used as a proper name, use the capitalization of the product, such as GNUPro, Source-Navigator, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. When used as a command, use lowercase as appropriate, such as "To start GCC, type gcc."

  See also [commands](#commands).


  # **app, application** {#app,-application}

  Although "app" has entered common conversational and brand parlance, the term still has a significant attachment to mobile, single-use, or "disposable" applications. (Search volume for "apps" on Google as of June 2022 is 164K/month, while "applications" is 26K/month.) 

  To avoid risk of "app" being read as mobile-centric or non-enterprise technology, use "application," not "app," in each use.

  Exceptions:

* Use "app" in a "short name" for a product, service, or offering when it is allowed per our [official Red Hat product names list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLS_lS3VKidgZIvcLmLp9BoiqptkvqHWfe1D5FD2kfk/edit?usp=sharing). (For example, Red Hat App Studio is an acceptable short name for Red Hat Application Studio). 

  * Short names are approved for use in technical documentation.

  * Always use the full product, service, or offering name at least once in a document before using the short name. If the material is split over several chapters or pages or could be broken into parts and reused (for example, modular copy), the full name should be mentioned at least once in each part. 

* All Marketplace listings or other such purchasing copy should use the full name. 

* Shorten "application" to "app" where space is limited (for example, in titles or social media).

  # **application services** {#application-services}

  Application services are software solutions that improve the speed, security, and interoperability of applications.

  Red Hat Application Foundations is an example of application services, which help build, deploy, and operate applications in hybrid cloud environments.

  See also [cloud services](#cloud-services), [data services](#data-services), [managed services](#managed-services).


  # **application velocity**

  Used on its own, this phrase does not indicate what aspect of the application life cycle is faster because velocity means ‚Äúspeed in a given direction.‚Äù Always provide context on first mention for what exactly is moving faster (for example, application development velocity, development velocity, development and deployment velocity). Then, unless the meaning changes, you can use ‚Äúapplication velocity‚Äù subsequently. 

  For example, the OpenShift team has used this term to mean "creating a streamlined developer experience" whose context is key to setting audience expectations for their content.


  # **approach**

  Use "approach" to indicate one among several possible, repeatable methods of solving a problem. In software architecture "an approach" is less specific than a pattern, it instead involves a general set of practices used to address a problem.

  üõà **Note:** Pattern and approach are not interchangeable. The key difference between pattern and approach in software is in their relationship to design. Approach is a general set of practices used to solve a problem.


  # **architect**

  Do not use as a verb. While it might make sense in the correct context, using it as a verb can be jargon or unclear in meaning for your audience. Use "design," "build," "create," or another descriptive verb instead.

  üõà Note: Check with the writer to find out their intended meaning. For example, a sentence that mentions "rearchitecting" might require "refactoring" as a replacement rather than "rebuilding."


  # **ARM64, arm64** {#arm64,-arm64}

  A 64-bit version of the ARM architecture. Use this term for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform attributes, Kubernetes, operators, application programming interfaces (APIs), and command-line interface (CLI) objects.

  Use the uppercase format (ARM64) in general sentences when referring to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform features. Use lowercase format (arm64) ONLY when referring to objects or parameters. It may be styled as code (monospace font or a code-styled block) when referring to code.

  Cloud providers can use different formats of this term when using architectures. If you are documenting code, commands, or outputs, confer with your subject matter expert on the correct format for the specific use case.

  Example:

* In this exercise, we will create an ARM64 compute machine set.

* In this scenario, arm64 is a valid value for X.

  See also [Aarch64, aarch64 (n.)](#aarch64,-aarch64-\(n.\)); [AMD64, amd64](#amd64,-amd64); [Intel 64](#intel-64-\(n.\)); [x86\_64](#x86_64); [64-bit x86](#64-bit-x86-\(n.\)); [64-bit ARM](#64-bit-arm-\(n.\)).


  # **Asia Pacific**

  No hyphen. Shortened form of "Asia and the Pacific Rim region." 

  üõà **Note:** The APAC regional demand center (RDC) prefers the non-hyphenated spelling‚Äîso Asia Pacific, not Asia-Pacific.


  # **ask**

  It is a verb. Do not use it as a noun, for example: "What is the ask?"


  

  # **assure** {#assure}

  Assure suggests mental comfort. Example: "I assured my future father-in-law that I would eventually find a job." 

  See also [ensure](#ensure), [insure](#insure).


  # **as-a-Service** {#as-a-service}

  There is a great deal of overlap in as-a-Service acronyms. To avoid confusion, always spell out the full term on first possible use. 

  Some examples:

* Application Platform-as-a-Service (aPaaS)

* CaaS (Cloud-as-a-Service, Communications-as-a-Service, [Containers-as-a-Service](#containers-as-a-service))

* DRaaS (Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service)

* FaaS (Function\[s\]-as-a-Service)

* [iPaaS](#ipaas) (integration Platform-as-a-Service)

* MaaS (Messaging-as-a-Service)

* PaaS (Payments-as-a-Service, [Platform-as-a-Service](#platform-as-a-service-\(paas\)))

* SaaS (Search-as-a-Service, Security-as-a-Service, Storage-as-a-Service, or [Software-as-a-Service](#software-as-a-service-\(saas\)))

* SECaaS (Security-as-a-Service)

* TDBaaS (Time-series Database-as-a-Service)(Found in CL110 RH OpenStack Admin I)

* UCaaS (Unified Communications-as-a-Service)

  See also [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](#infrastructure-as-a-service-\(iaas\)), [iPaaS](#ipaas), [Load Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS](#load-balancing-as-a-service-\(lbaas\))), [Mobile Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS)](#mobile-backend-as-a-service), [Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)](#platform-as-a-service-\(paas\)), [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](#software-as-a-service-\(saas\)), [xPaaS](#xpaas).

  When using as-a-Service acronyms:

* Capitalize the noun (for example, Platform, Software, Infrastructure) and Service, both when abbreviated and written out.

* When in all capitals, such as a title or headline, the aa in the acronym remains lowercase (for example, INTRODUCTION TO PaaS SOLUTIONS).

* Hyphenate when written out: Thing-as-a-Service. For two-word prefixes, do not include a hyphen between the first and second words: Mobile Backend-as-a-Service. Can be used as an adjective to describe multiple (such as when referring to an IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, use as-a-Service offerings, as-a-Service products, or similar wording).

* Avoid an acronym if it could stand for more than one term in a single asset‚Äîfor example, if you're writing content that discusses both Cloud-as-a-Service and Containers-as-a-Service).

  # **as well as**

  Not interchangeable with "and." "As well as" used in a series places more emphasis on the items preceding it, whereas "and" places equal weight on all items in the series. For example: "We sell kitchen electronics and china, as well as some gourmet foods." But, "We sell kitchen electronics, china, and silverware."


  # **artificial intelligence (AI)**

  Spell out ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù on first use, and do not capitalize the term. Do not assume that all languages or audiences understand that ‚ÄúAI‚Äù stands for artificial intelligence and machine learning.

  See also generative AI, gen AI.


  # **autodetect**


  # **automagic**

  Not a word. If we mean "automatic," then say that.


  # **Autofs**

  A program for automatically mounting directories on an as-needed basis.

  # **backport**


  # **back end (n.); back-end (adj.)**

  Do not hyphenate when the phrase does not precede a noun.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ when comparing front-end and back-end infrastructure.

* ‚Ä¶ when comparing infrastructure in the back end and the front end of your application.

  # **back up (v.); backup (n. or adj.)** {#back-up-(v.);-backup-(n.-or-adj.)}

* Do not hyphenate when used as adjective or noun; for example, startup investment and backup singer.

* Write as two words when used as a verb; for example, back up the computer.

  * Do not split the phrase: "Back the computer up" should not be used; it's "back up the computer."

  # **backtrace**

  A synonym for stack trace, or ‚Äúa hierarchical trace of the function calls made by a program, used in debugging.‚Äù


  # **backward, backward compatibility** {#backward,-backward-compatibility}

  Don‚Äôt use "backwards." Discuss backward compatibility with caution, as claims may promise future actions that are legally binding. Don‚Äôt use ‚Äúbackwards compatibility.‚Äù Example: "This solution will be backward compatible with at least 3 previous releases." 

  See also [forward, forward compatibility](#forward,-forward-compatibility); [future-proof](#future-proof).


  # **bandwidth** {#bandwidth}

  In telecommunications, ‚Äúbandwidth‚Äù refers to the maximum rate of data transfer. Often used as corporate jargon to refer to the resources (time, effort, attention) needed to complete a task or project; do not use in this context.

  See also [bps, Bps](#bps,-bps); [Hz](#hz).


  # **bare metal (n.); bare-metal (adj.)**

  Do not hyphenate when the phrase does not precede a noun.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ in bare-metal environments.

* ‚Ä¶ when deploying to environments that are bare metal or hosted in a private cloud.


  # **basically** {#basically}

  Do not use. For example, removing the word "basically" in the following sentence strengthens it: "This is how it is basically done."


  # **because** {#because}

  Do not use "since" to mean "because." Use "because" to refer to a reason. Use "since" to refer to the passage of time.


  # **below**

  Do not use to refer to information mentioned "below." When documents are converted to HTML or laid out in a print template, the information may no longer be "below."


  # **best-of-breed (adj.)**

  Jargon; do not use. Instead, say exactly what you mean, for example: "the Linux platform ranked \#1 in Forbes' Platform Awards" or "the leading middleware solution by downloads." (And cite a source to back up your claim.) Try instead: The best, foremost, most advanced, optimum. The category is usually implied."


  # **BIOS**

  Acronym for basic input/output system. Plural is BIOSes.


  # **big data**

  Although big data is important to our business, it is not a proper noun. Do not capitalize it unless it is part of a proper Red Hat product, service, solution, or organization or team name. Big data is also never hyphenated, per AP style, even when used as a complex adjective. 

  See also [cloud](#cloud-\(n.,-adj.\)).


  # **bimodal IT** {#bimodal-it}

  Outdated Gartner phrase for the combination of traditional (mode 1 or type 1\) and modern (mode 2 or type 2\) IT infrastructure and resources. There are many ways to talk about this combination approach; be sure you use the right phrase for your audience. Using only the Gartner term can alienate other analysts or those not familiar with Gartner's phrasing.

  We often refer to the practice of having both modes together as hybrid, agile, or modern IT. (Note: Hybrid IT is a more general term, so it could mean on-premise plus public cloud, for example. Agile and modern IT can both carry an implication of "mode 2," so when using those terms, be specific about the exact technology combination you mean.)

  See also [2-track IT](#2-track-\(it\)\(adj.\)), [classic IT](#classic-it), [frictionless](#frictionless), [hybrid IT](#hybrid-it), [mode 1/mode 2](#mode-1/mode-2), [modern IT](#modern-it), [traditional IT](#traditional-it), [seamless](#seamless), [type 1/type 2](#type-1/type-2-\(it\)\(adj.\)).


  # **biweekly, bimonthly**

  Avoid using the prefixes bi- and semi- (for example, biweekly, semiweekly). People have trouble remembering if biweekly means "every two weeks" or "twice a week." Semiweekly has a similar problem. Even though both terms have clear dictionary definitions, we recommend that you avoid them in favor of clear communication.

* Instead of biweekly, use "every two weeks" or "every other week."

* Instead of semiweekly/semimonthly, use "twice a week."

  Similar terms to avoid:

* fortnight (or fortnightly): This term is not common in American English and may also be unfamiliar to non-native speakers.

* thrice: Say "three times" instead.

  # **bit rate**


  

  # **Black** {#black}

  Use the capitalized term as an adjective in a racial, ethnic, or cultural sense: Black people, Black employees, Black coders.

  See also [black/white](#black/white), [inclusive language](#inclusive-language).


  

  # **black/white** {#black/white}

  Do not use these terms in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad, such as "whitelist" "blacklist." (You can use "allowlist" and "denylist" instead.) Such usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias.

  See also [inclusive language](#inclusive-language).


  # **blacklist** {#blacklist}

  Do not use. Instead, use "blocklist" or "denylist." 

  See also [inclusive language](#inclusive-language), [whitelist](#whitelist).


  # **bleeding edge**

  Avoid this phrase. It is a metaphor and might not translate clearly to global audiences. It is also dated. Instead, try new, innovative, or modern.


  # **Boolean**


  # **boot disk**


  # **boot loader**


  # **bottom line; the bottom line (n.)**

  Traditionally used in financial contexts. Avoid it otherwise; it's overused.


  # **bps, Bps** {#bps,-bps}

  Bits per second is abbreviated "bps." Bytes per second is abbreviated "Bps." 

  See also [bandwidth](#bandwidth).


  # **Britain**

  The language is English, and the place is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is also known as "the U.K." Using Britain/British is usually incorrect, and to some, implies a specific subjective statement about the state of Northern Ireland.


  # **bucketize**

  Not a word. Instead, try "categorize" or "organize into logical groups."


  

  # **bulleted lists** {#bulleted-lists}

  Use a list when any of the following are true:

* There are 3 or more items in a series.

* You're providing instructions.

* A series would be hard to read (or awkward) in sentence form.

  **Capitalization:**

  Capitalize the first word of each bullet.

  **Types of lists:**

* Bullet: Use when the order of the items does not matter.

* Number: Use when the order of the items matters, such as writing instructions.

* Letter: Use when the order doesn‚Äôt matter, but you want to refer to a specific item later. When referring back to it, enclose it in parentheses.

  **Punctuation:**

* Colon: Use a colon after the introductory phrase, clause, or sentence.

* Period:

  * When the bulleted list items complete a sentence (when read following the introductory phrase to the bulleted list) or are sentences themselves, use periods at the end of each item.

  * When the bulleted items don‚Äôt complete a sentence or aren‚Äôt complete sentences (i.e., are just a list of items), no periods are necessary.

  * When a list contains a mix of complete and incomplete sentences, first try to rewrite them to all be parallel. Short of that, end all items in the list with a period.

  **Parallel construction (also known as parallel structure):** 

  List items should be similar in structure. If, for example, some are complete sentences and others fragments, you should rewrite so that all are sentences (or all are fragments). Ideally, the grammatical structure of each list item would also be the same.

  So, for example, a list like this one:

  *This new release features:*

* *Widget technology.*

* *Improved security features*

* *access control through Acme management console.*

* *And it is based on kernel 2.2.2.2 technology*

* *The subscription includes standard support and access to the Red Hat Customer Portal.*

  Would become a list like this:

  *This new release features:*

* *Widget technology.*

* *Improved security features.*

* *Access control through Acme management console.*

* *Technology based on kernel 2.2.2.2.*

* *A subscription that includes standard support and access to the Red Hat Customer Portal.*

  # **business-critical (adj.)** {#business-critical-(adj.)}

  Like mission-critical, we would use ‚Äúbusiness-critical‚Äù only when clarity is needed and the subject is truly a functional necessity for the organization. Mission-critical software is essential to executing on the core reason an organization exists. Systems that are important to or support the core mission aren‚Äôt necessarily mission-critical, but may be ‚Äúbusiness-critical‚Äù if they have a significant impact on the organization. For example, administrative system, marketing dashboard, and email system failures can cause mission-critical disruptions, but if that disruption is of short duration or does not significantly affect customers, the ability to do business, or finances‚Äîit may be business-critical instead.

  See also [mission-critical (adj.)](#mission-critical-\(adj.\)).

  # **CamelCase** {#camelcase}

  Also called "camel notation," "mixed case," "InterCapped," and "StudlyCaps." 

  Use CamelCase when:

* You‚Äôre creating materials that follow The IBM Style Guide.

* It's an established product name or technology ( OpenStack, OpenShift).

* The initialism or abbreviation has a preposition connecting words. (Center of Excellence should be CoE, not COE; Community of Practice should be CoP, not COP).


  # **can/may**

  Use "can" to describe actions or conditions that are possible. Use "may" only to describe situations where permission is being given.


  # **cannot** 

  # **canceled**


  # **CapEx** {#capex}

  Financial term. Short for ‚Äúcapital expenditures‚Äù.

  See also [OpEx](#opex). 


  # **capitalization** {#capitalization}

At Red Hat, we are humble, speak (and write) truthfully, and avoid making things seem more important than they are. We aim for consistency. And as a result, we don't bend our capitalization rule. It's one of the few places where our style is really set apart. We don't want to sound like everyone else, act like everyone else, look like everyone else. There are also practical reasons why we don't capitalize every little word, including:

* Clarifying what are and are not official Red Hat offerings.

* Discouraging the practice of "let's capitalize this Important Idea to make it look more important." The idea's importance should be able to stand on its own‚Äîwithout capitalization.

* Providing a potentially easier approach than title case. Some people might not use title case consistently; for example, the decision to capitalize "a," "and," "the," and "your" when using title case.

* If it's not the official name of a Red Hat offering (with a SKU) or department or team, don't capitalize it (even if it seems important).

So that‚Äôs why we:

* Capitalize only the first letter of the first word in headlines, titles, subtitles, and other call-out text.

  * Refer to [Fonts and typography: Case](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards/typography#case) in the Brand Standards for more information.

* Capitalize job titles. Example: "Bob Smith, Group Manager, Acme Widgets" or "Acme Widgets Group Manager Bob Smith."

* Do not capitalize job personas. 

  * See also [department names](#department-names), [commands](#commands), [personas](#personas).

* Do not capitalize domain names, even when they begin a sentence (but try to avoid starting a sentence with a domain name). Example: "redhat.com is awesome." When writing a domain name that does not belong to Red Hat, adhere to that entity's capitalization. If you can't determine how they capitalize it, default to Red Hat's style. Keep in mind that screen readers may have trouble speaking domain names with more than 1 word. Use good judgment in deciding how to write multiword domain names; if needed for clarity, use CamelCase. 

  * See also [URLs](#urls).

  **Exceptions:**

* Technical documentation uses title case and uses titlecase.com as a reference, for consistency.

* The Customer Experience & Engagement team capitalizes all words in titles except articles and prepositions, and we also do the same for press release titles. When referencing titles from external publications, use the same case (sentence or title) that the publication used.

* If there's a colon in a title that would otherwise be sentence-case, the first word after the colon is capitalized. Example: "Bats of African beaches: Everything you need to know."

* Official service-level agreement (SLA) defect ratings (Severity 1, Severity 2, etc.) This distinguishes the SLA-defined ratings from the severity of general issues and identifies them as requiring a predetermined response time and level of support according to agreements.

* The main words of book titles, including prepositions and conjunctions of four or more letters, and verbs including is and are.

* Podcast names and episode titles. For example, Command Line Heroes season 1 episode 3 The Agile\_Revolution.

* Event names, such as Red Hat Summit or Red Hat AI Roadshow. See also [event names](#event-names).

* ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù as an adjective in a racial, ethnic, or cultural sense.

  # **cd, CD**

  When referring to the change directory command, use "cd." When referring to a compact disk, use "CD." The plural abbreviation for compact disks is "CDs."


  # **center of competence; center of competency**

  Jargon. Refers to a group of people, a department, or a shared facility of common knowledge on a topic. Do not use unless part of an organization/team name. Use more specific language instead when possible.


  # **Ceph** {#ceph}

  Not CEPH. It takes a registered trademark (¬Æ or ‚Äúr-ball‚Äù) on first use. 

  See also [Inktank](#inktank).


  # **cgroups**

  At the beginning of a sentence, use "Cgroups."


  # **check box**


  # **chipset**


  # **choiceful**

  Not a word; do not use. Try "careful" or "thoughtful" or rephrase as: "make smart choices" or "make hard choices."


  # **CI/CD** {#ci/cd}

  Define on first use; generally continuous integration and continuous delivery, but sometimes wrongly used for continuous integration and continuous deployment. Also, this is not the same thing as continuous development, a term with questionable usefulness and only marginal adoption. 

  See also [continuous integration (CI)](#continuous-integration-\(ci\)), [continuous delivery (CD)](#continuous-delivery-\(cd\)), [continuous deployment](#continuous-deployment).


  # **ciphertext**


  # **circle back**

  Avoid this idiom used to mean "getting back to something or someone." It may not translate to global audiences. Instead, say "let's meet again" or "I'll let you know what was said after I talk to them." Be specific about how you will check or convey information. 

  See also [reach out](#reach-out-\(v.\)).


  # **citations**

  See the [citation style guide](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/word-nerds/red_hat_word_nerds_wiki/citation_style_guide).


  # **classic IT** {#classic-it}

  An IT infrastructure approach that generally includes physical hardware that is optimized for specific applications and resources. Can also be referred to as mode 1, type 1, or traditional. 

  See also [bimodal IT](#bimodal-it), [traditional IT](#traditional-it).


  # **click** {#click}

  Avoid where possible, as many people access content on mobile devices and may not be using a mouse.

  See also [click here](#click-here), [double-click](#double-click).


  # **click here** {#click-here}

  Avoid this archaic term from ye olde internet. Instead, link to specifics and explain what the link offers; for example, not "To read the datasheet, click here," but "Read the datasheet."

  See also [click](#click), [double-click](#double-click).


  # **client side (n.); client-side (adj.)**

  For example: Windbind runs on the client side \[noun\] of a client/server Samba implementation. Windbind is a client-side \[adjective\] service used to connect to Windows NT servers. 

  Do not hyphenate when the phrase does not precede a noun.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ in a client-side application.

* ‚Ä¶ when deploying to the server‚Äôs client side.

  See also [server side (n.), server-side (adj.)](#server-side-\(n.\),-server-side-\(adj.\)).


  # **cloud (n., adj.)** {#cloud-(n.,-adj.)}


  # **cloudbursting**

  Define it briefly on the first occurrence: An application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or datacenter and bursts into a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity spikes. The advantage of a hybrid cloud deployment is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when they are needed.


  # **cloud service provider (CSP)**

  A third-party company offering one or more cloud-based platforms, applications, infrastructure, or storage options. Use "cloud service provider," not "cloud services provider."


  # **cloud services** {#cloud-services}

  Infrastructure, platforms, or software hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet.

  "Red Hat Cloud Services" is the family name referring to the managed cloud services portfolio for Red Hat OpenShift. It includes Red Hat OpenShift cloud services, application services, and data services.

  "Red Hat OpenShift cloud services" is the descriptive term for platform services that are a subset of Red Hat Cloud Services.

  When referencing actions someone can take with cloud services, try to phrase the sentence around the portfolio or subset of services to emphasize the reference to a singular, bundled offering, for example, "The Red Hat Cloud Services portfolio helps you...". If that isn't possible or in instances where character count is limited, use a plural verb because the subject ("Red Hat Cloud Services") is plural. "Red Hat OpenShift cloud services let you...".

  See also [application services](#application-services), [data services](#data-services), [managed services](#managed-services).


  # **cloudwashing**

  The purposeful and sometimes deceptive attempt by a vendor to rebrand an old product or service by associating the buzzword "cloud" with it. (Source: [TechTarget](http://searchcloudstorage.techtarget.com/definition/cloud-washing))


  # **Co.Lab**

  The name of this Open Source Stories program was originally written as CO.LAB. Some time around late 2018 or early 2019, it was changed to Co.Lab. It's written in mixed case like this, with no spaces.


  # **combination box, combo box**

  Do not use "combo box" as an abbreviation of "combination box." In instructions about how to use a graphical interface, use the name of the field, as in "the Servers field." In instructions to explain how to create a graphical interface to interface developers, use "combination box." This recommendation follows the [IBM Style Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style).


  # **commas**

  Use serial (Oxford) commas. Because in some cases it is necessary to use a serial comma to avoid confusion, we always use it for consistency. A serial comma is the comma before "and" in a series of three or more items: 

  *Item 1, item 2, and item 3\.*

  If using an ampersand in a headline or heading, place a comma before the ampersand. Example in context: 

  *Transform, optimize, & protect*.

  üõà Exceptions: Our press releases follow stricter journalism rules/AP style, where it's traditional not to use serial commas.


  # **comma-delimited (adj.)**


  # **commands**  {#commands}

  Many proper nouns and other words, especially commands and names of open source projects, begin with a lowercase letter. How should those words be treated when they begin a sentence? AP Style guidance:

  *For words like iPad or iPod, AP Style recommends that they be styled with an uppercase letter when beginning a sentence. So "IPads are selling poorly in Q4" or "IPods are no longer the best-selling holiday item now that people listen to music on their phones."*

  AP Style has no guidance for command names. However, Linux makes distinctions based on capitalization that would make a capitalized command incorrect. For example, with "ls" and "Ls"‚Äîa user reading a document, blog post, or other material where the command name has been capitalized may have reason to expect they could use \`Ls\` but that will be met with an error.

  Here are some ways to handle commands and open source project names that begin with a lowercase:

| Recommended solution | Before | After |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *Rewrite the sentence:* In many cases this problem can be solved by simply rewriting so that a word that is supposed to be lowercase is not the first word in the sentence. | openSUSE was the first Linux distribution to use RPM deltas. systemd is the default init system for most Linux distributions today. | The openSUSE distribution was the first Linux distro to use RPM deltas. The default init system for most Linux distributions is systemd.  |
| *Capitalize proper nouns that are not commands if rewriting isn't possible:* If there's a good reason not to rewrite the sentence or it's just not possible, then proper nouns that are not commands should be capitalized. | systemd is the default init system for most Linux distributions today. | Systemd is the default init system for most Linux distributions today. |
| *When possible, style commands as code:* This way, it is obvious to the reader that it's a command, variable, or similar. | var\_init is the variable used by foo program to determine the init system in use. | `var_init` is the variable used by foo program to determine the init system in use. |


  üõà **Note:** Never change a command to uppercase. Because it can be confusing to readers and cause things to break, never capitalize a command name, utility, program variable, etc. that would be used at the command line or otherwise is case-sensitive.

  See also [capitalization](#capitalization); [app, applications](#app,-application).


  # **command-driven (adj.)**


  # **command language, line, processor**


  # **commodity**

  Avoid using "commodity" when referring to hardware, including servers or storage, because it implies that the hardware is undifferentiated and can make conservative readers think it is cheap. Use "industry-standard" or "volume" instead.


  # **communications service provider (CSP)** {#communications-service-provider-(csp)}

  Another way to refer to a telecommunications provider. 

  See also [service provider](#service-provider), [telecom](#telecom), [telecommunications service provider](#telecommunications-service-provider), [telco](#telco).


  # **compliance, compliant, certification (legal and regulatory)** {#compliance,-compliant,-certification-(legal-and-regulatory)}

  Care needs to be taken when characterizing an offering as ‚Äúcertified‚Äù or ‚Äúcompliant‚Äù with a particular law or standard. For example, no software can ever be fully HIPAA compliant, because HIPAA compliance is not solely a function of technology but how it is used. While certain software can support HIPAA compliance, it cannot guarantee HIPAA compliance. To support HIPAA compliance, software must include a number of security features, and merely hosting software in a ‚ÄúHIPAA-certified‚Äù environment does not render the software HIPAA compliant.

  Example: ‚ÄúBy placing Red Hat OpenShift on Azure, Red Hat can serve customers in compliance with HIPAA.‚Äù

* This statement suggests that Red Hat is prepared to function as a HIPAA ‚Äúbusiness associate,‚Äù which may not be accurate. Better to say ‚ÄúThis offering can help customers comply with HIPAA‚Äôs security requirements.‚Äù

* There is also no official program which ‚Äúcertifies‚Äù a software product as being HIPAA compliant. When using the term ‚Äúcertified‚Äù in connection with a Red Hat offering, be specific about the nature of the certification.

  A better way to talk about certifications: ‚ÄúTake advantage of the latest version of OpenShift while optimizing costs with flexible pricing, and functionality supporting key industry certifications.‚Äù

  See also [secure, secures, security](#secure,-secures,-security).


  # **consume (v.)** {#consume-(v.)}

  Primarily refers to eating, drinking, or ingesting food. When something is consumed, it is used up. Avoid using this term externally in marketing materials because it is often jargon, and it may not translate well. Instead, when referring to content (like videos, articles, or whitepapers, for example), use specific actions like "read," "downloaded," "watched," "bought," "installed," or "used."

  Exceptions:

* "Consumption" is a metric used by Adobe Analytics, and the term can be used internally to describe when a marketing asset has been accessed. For example, "The site visitor consumed the whitepaper," or "The site visitor consumed the video.")

* It's also used in use-based pricing, such as for cloud. For example, "consumption-based pricing."

  See also [usage](#usage), [utilize](#utilize).


  # **Containers-as-a-Service** {#containers-as-a-service}

  The term "Containers-as-a-Service" is owned by Docker and should only be used when referring to that company's offering.

  See also [as-a-Service](#as-a-service).


  # **container-based (adj.)**

  Used to refer to more complex applications made up of multiple services that are distributed via containers. More common than "containerized."


  # **containerized**

  Used when we refer to an application or service that is distributed in or as a container or packed into a container.


  # **continuous delivery (CD)** {#continuous-delivery-(cd)}

  A software implementation architecture that ensures all approved code can be easily moved into (or "pushed to") production.

  See also [CI/CD](#ci/cd), [continuous integration (CI)](#continuous-integration-\(ci\)), [continuous deployment](#continuous-deployment).


  # **continuous deployment** {#continuous-deployment}

  A special case of continuous delivery, where approved code is automatically pushed to production. Do not use "CD" to refer to this practice. This is not the D in CI/CD; the D in that construct stands for continuous delivery. 

  See also [CI/CD](#ci/cd), [continuous integration (CI)](#continuous-integration-\(ci\)), [continuous delivery (CD)](#continuous-delivery-\(cd\)).


  # **continuous integration (CI)** {#continuous-integration-(ci)}

  A software development architecture where the developer code branch is synchronized with a higher-level code branch or main multiple times per day. Development always works with the current code base. 

  See also [CI/CD](#ci/cd), [continuous delivery (CD)](#continuous-delivery-\(cd\)), [continuous deployment](#continuous-deployment).


  # **contractions** {#contractions}

  Using contractions (isn't, you're, I'm) in content that‚Äôs less formal‚Äïincluding many kinds of marketing content such as web pages, emails, Red Hat swag, and social media posts‚Äïis generally fine.

  Avoid using contractions in more formal content, such as policy manuals, technical documentation, marketing collateral (with the exception of e-books), and legal contracts or other binding documents.

  For localized content in most languages, contractions are commonplace and can be used. However, they are less common in Spanish and Chinese, and may lack direct equivalents or obscure intended meaning in those languages. So use caution when planning to create or translocate to these languages.

  For translation purposes, common contractions include:

| Contraction | Full phrase |
| :---- | :---- |
| I‚Äôm | I am |
| You‚Äôre | You are |
| He‚ÄôsShe‚ÄôsIt‚Äôs | He is She is It is |
| Can‚Äôt Won‚Äôt Don‚Äôt | Cannot Do not Will not |
| Shouldn‚Äôt Wouldn‚Äôt Couldn‚Äôt | Should not Would not Could not |
| Isn‚Äôt Aren‚Äôt | Is not Are not |
| Haven‚Äôt Hasn‚Äôt | Have not Has not |
| Wasn‚Äôt Weren‚Äôt | Was not Were not |
| Ain‚Äôt | Can mean am not, is not, are not, has not, or have not  Do not use, unless you are referring to the legendary Red Hat Linux [Redneck install](https://imgur.com/gallery/installing-1998-redhat-w-redneck-language-option-yX5uw). |


  

  # **control character**

  Per Wikipedia, ‚Äúa code point in a character set that does not represent a written character or symbol.‚Äù Contrast to graphic characters, also known as printing characters (or printable characters).


  # **control key**

  To indicate this key on a keyboard, use "Ctrl." For example, "To undo what you last typed, press Ctrl+z."


  # **control program**


  # **coopetition, co-opetition**

  Made-up word used to refer to "cooperative competition." Do not use.


  # **core competency**

  Jargon; avoid if possible. Better choices include "specialization," "skill," "strength," "expertise," or similar words. Other ways to say it: "what your organization does best," "competitive advantage," "special or unique expertise or ability," or "specialty."


  # **cost savings**

  Inaccurate. ‚ÄúCosts‚Äù cannot be saved; they can be improved or reduced. Instead, use ‚Äúfinancial savings‚Äù.


  # **cross-site scripting**

  A type of cyberattack where ‚Äúmalicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites‚Äù.


  # **cross-platform**


  # **currency** {#currency}

  Generally, we don‚Äôt provide currency conversions outside of U.S. dollars and euros.

  For U.S. dollars, use the first 2 letters of the country's ISO code before the dollar sign, ‚Äú$.‚Äù Spell out the word ‚Äúcents‚Äù when referencing a monetary amount less than 1 U.S. dollar. If the copy is for an event or international audience where currency clarity is needed, include ‚ÄúU.S. dollars‚Äù on first use as shown in the examples.

  Examples:

* The cost for this conference in 2002 was US$1,500.

* That burger costs only US$5.

* Your change is 47 cents.

For an event or an international audience, on first use: 

* The cost for this conference in 2002 was US$1,500 (U.S. dollars).

  Although our standard is to keep currency conversion to U.S. dollars and euros only and pricing is typically presented across our digital properties in U.S. dollars, there are instances where we may reference pricing in other countries that use dollars as their form of currency. When doing so, precede the numerals with the first 2 letters of each respective ISO country code and a dollar sign (with no spaces between):

* Australia: AU$1,500

* Hong Kong: HK$1,500

* Canada: CA$1,500

  We may also occasionally reference other currencies in translated content at the discretion of localization leads: 


| Language | Guidance and examples |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Spanish (ES)** | Because the Spanish language is used across 20 Latin American countries and Spain, and each country uses a different currency, our standard practice is to convert currency to U.S. dollars in Spanish content.  |
| **Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR)** | The general standard for Brazilian Reals is to use capital ‚ÄúR‚Äù followed by the dollar sign, a space, and then numerals. In Brazil, a decimal point is used as the thousands' separator, rather than a comma, and a comma is used in place of a decimal point: R$ 1.500 R$ 0,50 (50 cents) The term ‚ÄúBrazilian Real‚Äù can be abbreviated to ‚ÄúBRL‚Äù. |
| **German (DE)** | Pricing in German is in euro, with the ‚Äú‚Ç¨‚Äù symbol or ‚ÄúEUR‚Äù placed after the numerals and a space.  In German, a comma is used in place of the decimal separator. ‚ÄúU.S. dollar‚Äù is written as ‚ÄúUS-Dollar‚Äù in German (no periods after ‚ÄúU‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù, hyphenated, uppercase ‚ÄúDollar‚Äù). 100 EUR or 100 ‚Ç¨ 14,8 Mio. US-Dollar |
| **French (FR)** | Pricing in French is in euro, with the ‚Äú‚Ç¨‚Äù symbol or ‚ÄúEUR‚Äù placed after the numerals and a space. 100 EUR or 100 ‚Ç¨ |
| **Italian (IT)** | Pricing in Italian is in euro, with the ‚Äú‚Ç¨‚Äù symbol or ‚ÄúEUR‚Äù placed after the numerals and a space). In Italian a comma is used as the decimal separator.  100 EUR or 100 ‚Ç¨ 14,8 milioni USD |
| **Simplified Chinese (ZH)** | Renminbi (RMB) is the official currency of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, of which the yuan is the basic unit.  Pricing for Simplified Chinese is commonly displayed with the numerals placed before a space and the abbreviation ‚ÄúRMB‚Äù on first reference, and the Chinese yuan ‚Äú¬•‚Äù symbol followed by a space and numerals on subsequent references. 1500 RMB (first reference) ¬• 1500 (subsequent references) |
| **Japanese (JA)** | The Japanese yen is the official currency of Japan. On first reference, use numerals placed before a space and the Japanese character for yen, ÂÜÜ.  For subsequent references, use the symbol for yen, Ôø•, followed by the numerals (with no space in between). 1,000 ÂÜÜ (first reference) Ôø•1,000 (subsequent references) |
| **Korean (KO)** | The won is the official currency of South Korea. On first reference, use the won symbol, ‚Ç©, before numerals with no space in between. For subsequent references, use numerals followed by a space and the word ‚ÄúWon‚Äù. ‚Ç©1,500 (first reference) 1,500 Won (subsequent references) |

  When possible, use em-dashes (‚Äî) with no space on either side. When full em-dashes aren't available, use double-dashes with no spaces on either side‚Äîlike this. See also em dash.

  Exceptions: In technical publications, the IBM Style Guide recommends not to use em dashes or en dashes at all. Use a colon or other suitable punctuation.

  See also [‚Äî](#‚Äî) , [em dash (‚Äî)](#em-dash-\(‚Äî\))


  # **datacenter**


  # **datastore**

  üõà In technical publications, the [IBM Style Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) recommends the two-word form, "data store."


  # **data mirroring**


  # **data point**

  Refers to a discrete unit of information. Unless you're talking analytics, use "fact" instead.


  # **data services** {#data-services}

  Data services are used for managing stored data, moving data, and using data.

  Examples:

* Red Hat Ceph Storage is an open, scalable, software-defined storage system that efficiently manages petabytes of data.

* Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation is software-defined storage that gives data a persistent (accessible) location as containers are provisioned across environments.

* Red Hat OpenShift Data Science is an open source machine learning (ML) platform for hybrid cloud used for training, deploying, and monitoring ML workloads and models on premise and in public cloud environments. 

  See also [application services](#application-services), [cloud services](#cloud-services), [managed services](#managed-services).


  # **data set**


  # **data type**


  # **datasheet**


  # **dates**

  When written out in body copy or content, use local date format or default U.S. style:

  *Month DD, YYYY*

  *DD Month, YYYY (non-US)* 

  When used as a numeric value or label, use the ISO Standard 8601: 

  *YYYY-MM-DD* 

  For other uses, see [months](#months).


  # **Day 0, Day 1, Day 2**

  Use the initial cap and write it this way even when used as an adjective (e.g., Day 1 operations, not Day-1 operations)


  # **debug**


  # **decision maker**


  # **deep dive (n.); deep-dive (v.)**

  Jargon. Don't use as a verb ("We'll deep-dive into storage metrics"), and try to avoid using as a noun ("We'll provide a deep dive on the topic"). Better choices include:

* Verb: "review," "examine in detail"

* Noun: "a thorough review," "a comprehensive study"

  # **DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion)**

  Use DEI when referring to Red Hat's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and teams. D\&I, or"diversity and inclusion"can be used descriptively, or to talk about Red Hat's community groups.


  # **denial of service (DoS); denial-of-service attack (DoS attack)**

  Refers to a type of cyberattack. Not to be confused with DOS, the operating system.

   

  # **department names** {#department-names}

  The preferred word is "team," regardless of size or function. Do not use "business unit" in external-facing documents. Use "organization" to distinguish a department from its subteams or otherwise call attention to its large, multiteam nature: "The OpenShift Engineering team is part of the Red Hat Engineering organization."

* When displayed as a title or caption, capitalize all words including team or organization: "Red Hat Finance Team," "Red Hat IT Organization"

* When using in context or in a sentence, don't capitalize words like team or organization: "As a member of the Red Hat Finance team...," "...with our Global Workplace Solutions team."

  See also [capitalization](#capitalization).


  # **DevOps**

  A portmanteau combining "development" and "operations." It refers to a specific method or organizational approach where developers and IT operations work together to create the applications that run the business. DevOps may refer to the engineers and developers that work within these modern IT organizations or the approach to culture, automation, and platform design that delivers increased business value and responsiveness through rapid, iterative, and high-quality IT services.

  Various terms are commonly used in reference to DevOps: hybrid IT, bimodal (per Gartner), and the constituent traditional (mode/type 1, classic) and modern (mode/type 2, agile) IT practices. Choose terms based on your audience.

  For additional information, refer to [Concepts & terms in the messaging index](https://source.redhat.com/about_red_hat/messagingindex/messaging_index_wiki/concepts__terms).


  # **dialog box**

  The operating system equivalent of a web pop-up window.


  # **digital transformation**

  Avoid using these phrases without proper context and detail. Also be wary of overuse and repetition. The word ‚Äútransform‚Äù implies a process with a beginning and end, and when talking about a transformation effort both challenges and goals should be clear.

  Digital leaders transform their organizations by using technology to:

* Do something faster.

* Do something differently.

* Do something completely new.

  Digital transformation encompasses culture, process, and technology. If you must discuss the concepts of digital transformation or digital leadership, briefly define what you mean on the first occurrence. Describe, rather than label.

  **Examples:**

* Companies of all sizes are working through digital transformation by optimizing their IT infrastructure to respond quickly to customer needs.

* Automating and streamlining workflows and eliminating manual processes.

* Accelerating application development using cloud-native processes and technologies to create new services and better customer experiences.

* Using machine learning combined with IoT to more quickly detect problems in factories and other facilities and enable more effective predictive maintenance.

* Creating a digital strategy for collecting and responding to customer insights.

* \[Customer name\] managed a comprehensive digital transformation by shifting toward lean agile development, integrated DevSecOps, creating a safe environment for change, and product portfolio management.

  # **different**

  Use "different from" rather than "different than."

   

  # **disabled**

  Do not use to refer to a person; use "person with disabilities" instead. Use "disabled" only to refer to an interface element that is displayed but cannot be used. If the interface element is not displayed, use "unavailable."

  See also [inclusive language](#inclusive-language).


  # **disc, disk**

  Compact disc, but diskette or hard disk.

   

  # **discount codes**

  Discount codes for events are case sensitive. Do not change the case of a discount code.

   

  # **Docker, docker**

  In general, do not use the terms "Docker" or "docker" to refer to generic containers. 

  See the [Container technology language and reference guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g8vwj0F3do7zaAAQkvaVapq15cNrN123kjb0UBAK8J8/edit) for more information and alternative terms to use.

   

  # **double-click** {#double-click}

  Avoid where possible, as many people access content on mobile devices and may not be using a mouse.

  See also [click](#click), [click here](#click-here).


  # **downtime**

  Use to describe the period during which a server, service, or other resource is unavailable.


  # **download**


  # **drive**

  Jargon, avoid using (also driving, driven, drove). Typically used as an imprecise catch-all for describing how an action, solution, or technology will lead to a favorable outcome. Actually means ‚Äúto propel‚Äù or ‚Äúto move forward,‚Äù and that is usually not an accurate description in the contexts that drive is used. Use verbs and phrasing that clearly show what leads to those favorable results instead.

  For example:

  *‚ÄúOpen source technology drives collaboration and innovation*‚Äù could be restated as: 

  *‚ÄúOpen source technology fosters collaboration, which accelerates innovation.‚Äù*

  or

  *‚ÄúThis innovative project is customer-driven‚Äù* could be restated as:

  *‚ÄúThis innovative project was led by Acme Corporation‚Äù* or *‚ÄúThis innovative project is responsive to customers‚Äô needs.‚Äù*

  Exceptions: Event-driven architecture (for example, Serverless and Kafka). ‚ÄúEvent‚Äù has a specific technical meaning in this context. When something is ‚Äúevent-driven,‚Äù events within a specific environment occur in response to specific events in that environment.


  # **dual-boot** 

  Refers to installing 2 or more operating systems on a single PC.

   

  # **DVD writer**

  Do not use "DVD burner" or "CD burner" (use CD writer in that case).

  # **e-book, e-business, e-commerce, e-learning**

  Refer to the primary reference, either the AP Stylebook or the IBM Style Guide, for the type of copy you are creating. At the beginning of a sentence or phrase, use E-book, not e-Book.

   

  # **e.g.** {#e.g.}

  e.g., means "for example." i.e., means "in other words." Use sparingly, and don't forget to include the comma (e.g.,). 

  üõà Exceptions: In technical publications, do not use these abbreviations at all. Similarly for "etc." Refer to the [IBM Style Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style) for more details.

  See also [i.e.](#i.e.)


  # **earlier**

  See [later, newer](#later,-newer).

   

  # **edge**

  Used to describe network elements outside of the gateway and server/cloud-side functions (for example, an edge device). Do not refer to "the edge" without qualifying; define first instance (for example, "the edge of the network").

   

  # **effect**

  See [affect](#affect).

   

  # **em dash (‚Äî)** {#em-dash-(‚Äî)}

  Used (informally) to indicate a pause or abrupt change in thought; for emphasis; or to set off a series in a phrase. No space on either side. If an em dash is unavailable, use two dashes with no space on either side.

  üõà Exceptions: Technical documentation does not use em dashes or en dashes at all. See the IBM Style Guide for details.

  Refer to the [Fonts and typography: Punctuation](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards/typography#punctuation) section of the Brand Standards for more information.

   

  # **Emacs** 

  A family of text editors. Originally named EMACS (an acronym for "Editor Macros").


  # **email**


  # **emerging products** {#emerging-products}

  Do not use. "Emerging" implies that a product is not ready for enterprise use. It also creates confusion between "emerging products" and "emerging technologies."

  See also [emerging technologies](#emerging-technologies).


  # **emerging technologies** {#emerging-technologies}

  Preferred over "emerging products." Refers to technologies (not products) that are new or still developing in the market. For example, blockchain, artificial intelligence, serverless.

  See also [emerging products](#emerging-products).


  # **enable (v.)**

  Jargon; avoid using. Often used to indicate what our products and services help our customers achieve but vaguely describes that relationship. Also has negative connotations related to helping destructive or unhealthy behavior continue. Describe what is actually happening or use words like ‚Äúhelp,‚Äù ‚Äúallow,‚Äù ‚Äúsupport,‚Äù or ‚Äúequip‚Äù instead.

  For example, ‚ÄúRed Hat Integration solutions enable customers to reap business benefits such as return on investment‚Äù could be restated as ‚ÄúRed Hat Integration solutions can help customers produce greater return on investment.‚Äù

  üõà Exceptions: 

* Using enable in the technical sense, as defined by Merriam-Webster: ‚Äúto cause (a feature or capability of a computer) to be active or available for use.‚Äù

* This guidance does not apply to the concept of enablement (n.), a term that is generally used to describe skills development or programs and teams that provide technical training or support.

  # **ensure** {#ensure}

  Ensure means "to make sure." 

  See also [assure](#assure), [insure](#insure).

   

  # **enterprise-grade, enterprise-ready (adj.)**

  Though we used to use this term to emphasize our products' enterprise readiness, it's not as necessary now. Unless you're calling this out as a key selling point or drawing a distinction between community and enterprise efforts, you should instead talk about what makes our software ideal for enterprise use, such as security, reliability, or expert support. Do not use when you are referring to a product with ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù in the name. 

  See ["What is enterprise open source?"](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-enterprise-open-source) for more info.

   

  # **essentially**

  Do not use. 

  See also [basically](#basically).

   

  # **Ethernet**

   

  # **event names** {#event-names}

  All event names should use title case. 

  Examples: 

* Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest (treated as a singular noun)

* Red Hat One

* Simplified System Management: A Red Hat Virtual Event

üõà **Note:** Make sure your event name is approved by the Brand Events team.

Review the [Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5L-nMXrwL-B5SYYw50TVeOVuXja1Bss63ORtiIR71A/edit?usp=sharing) entry for [*Red Hat Summit | Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O5L-nMXrwL-B5SYYw50TVeOVuXja1Bss63ORtiIR71A/edit#bookmark=id.u24q9oaco7wz).

See also [capitalization](#capitalization).

# **event years**

If the year is important, put it in front of the event name: *2025 Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest*. The year is important if it is necessary to what you're communicating about the event (i.e., would it still be true next year, or was it true the year before?). Put the year first if the information you're providing is relevant to that year only, or if the year it is happening needs emphasis. 

For example:

* "2025 Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest has 3,567 registered attendees as of January" (We have this many people registered for 2025 only, so the year goes first.)

* "2025 Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest will be held in Boston, MA." (In 2025, Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest will be held in Boston. Emphasis on the year, as it will be held elsewhere in other years.)

  If the year isn't important, put it after the event name. Example:

  *‚ÄúRed Hat Summit and AnsibleFest 2015 invites engineers, executives, and technology enthusiasts from all over the world."* (The year is not important to the message; it's a general description of the event that would be true of all years. But this text is in an invitation that's for this year, which is why the year is included.)

  If you're referring to an event in general, no year is needed. Example: 

  *"Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest averages 1,700 attendees a year, over the past 10 years.*" (Applies to all Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest events, so no date needed.)

  # **exceed expectations**

  Vague. Clarify with specifics; for example: "The movie made more money on the opening weekend than anyone expected."


  # **exclamation points (\!)** {#exclamation-points-(!)}

  Avoid overuse to maintain a composed, neutral tone. In the rare case when an exclamation point is warranted, use it only to express a high degree of surprise, incredulity, or other strong emotion. An exclamation point can also be used when referring to a command, such as the bang (\!) command.

  When using exclamation points in Spanish, always use an upside-down exclamation point (¬°) at the beginning of a sentence and a regular exclamation point (\!) at the end of a sentence. Use exclamation points sparingly in all languages to which Red Hat content is translated. 

  Never use more than one exclamation point at the end of a sentence.

  **Exceptions:** 

  In some use cases for the Talent Attraction & Experience (formerly, the Employment Brand) team, limited use of exclamation points is acceptable aligning with guiding principles:

  *Use when:*

* *The content is for, or alludes to, all associates rather than a single associate. Examples include:* 

* *Talent awards like Great Places to Work.*

* *We Are Red Hat Week.*

* *Promoting hiring events.*

  *Do not use when the content:*

* *Is for or about individuals.*

* *Will be replicated enough to start feeling overused or like a template*

* *Will be shared jointly on corporate social media channels like @RedHat or employment brand channels like @RedHatJobs.* 

  *Examples include:*

* *Employee service anniversaries.*

* *Red Hat Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) communities.*

* *Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest content.*

  # **exclusive (adj.)** {#exclusive-(adj.)}

  Often used to refer to events or experiences (for example, "This reception is an exclusive event"). Using the word "exclusive" often makes people feel like an organization is excluding people unnecessarily, or being vague in an attempt to get people to commit or sign up earlier. It can be perceived as false advertising. 

  Instead, be specific about what is restricted (for example, "Event is by invitation only," or "Event is for CIOs (a specific group) only.") 

  See also [space is limited](#space-is-limited).


  # **Exec-Shield**

  A project started at Red Hat in late 2002 with the aim of reducing the risk of worm or other automated remote attacks on Linux systems.

   

  # **Exif**

  Official term for exchangeable image file format. Do not use EXIF.

   

  # **ext3**

  Short form of third extended filesystem. Do not use EXT3.

   

  # **extranet** {#extranet}

  A private network that enterprises use to provide trusted third parties‚Äîsuch as suppliers, vendors, partners, customers and other businesses‚Äîsecure, controlled access to business information or operations. Do not capitalize, similar to internet.

  # **failover (n.); fail over (v.)**

   

  # **FAQ (sing.); FAQs (plural)**

  FAQ stands for ‚Äúfrequently asked questions‚Äù (with the ‚Äòs‚Äô denoting multiple questions listed). When we use FAQ in a sentence or body copy, we‚Äôre often referring to a single page where a user can find a list of commonly asked questions.

  Use FAQ when you are referencing 1 set of questions or answers related to 1 topic.

  Examples:

* Read the FAQ on Red Hat¬Æ Enterprise Linux¬Æ.

* Review our FAQ if you have additional questions on Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

* If you‚Äôre looking for additional information about Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest, take a look at our frequently asked questions.

* To view our Red Hat Learning Subscription FAQ, visit our Training & Certifications page.

  However, you should use FAQs when you are referencing a collection of multiple FAQs (lists of questions) on different topics (for example, multiple FAQ documents displayed on a single or multiple pages).

  Examples:

* Read the FAQs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux¬Æ, Red Hat OpenShift¬Æ, and Red Hat Ansible¬Æ Automation Platform.

* If you‚Äôd like to learn more about Red Hat on AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, view our FAQs.

* In the navigation bar, FAQ should be used if there is a single page of questions. FAQs can be used if there are several pages of different questions and answers addressing multiple topics.

  When referring to FAQ vs. FAQs in a header or sub-header, the same rules apply. 


  # **fault tolerance**

  The ability of a system to maintain proper operation in the event of failures or faults in one or more of its components.

   

  # **fiber**

  We use ‚Äúfiber,‚Äù not ‚Äúfibre‚Äù in all English language content. 

  üõà Exception: Fibre Channel (a high-speed data transfer protocol providing in-order, lossless delivery of raw block data.)

   

  # **figures**

  Use Figure 1, Figure 2, etc. to label images in copy: "Figure 1\. Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure include Red Hat CloudForms, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, and Red Hat OpenStack."

   

  # **fintech**

  Should be lowercased. When starting a sentence or a bullet, capitalize only the first letter (Fintech.) Do not use FinTech or fin-tech.


  # **file extensions**

  File extensions should be written using all caps without periods (for example, PDF) unless the file name is also referenced (for example, "Q2FY14\_writing\_for\_red\_hat.pdf").

   

  # **file name**

  Not ‚Äúfilename‚Äù.

   

  # **file system**

  Not ‚Äúfilesystem‚Äù.

   

  # **FireWire**

  The common name for IEEE 1394, a standard connection type for many electronic devices such as digital video cameras, printers and scanners, external hard drives, and other peripherals.

   

  # **firmware**

  Not ‚Äúfirm ware‚Äù or ‚Äúfirm-ware‚Äù.

   

  # **first come, first served**

  Use to indicate that customers will be attended to in the order that they arrive. The phrase abbreviates the sentence "The first to come is the first to be served," so use "served" instead of "serve" to keep the verb function the same. This phrase is an idiom, so avoid using when content will be translated. 

  When you use this phrase as an adjective, it is hyphenated like so:

  *"Admittance is on a first-come, first-served basis."*


  # **floating point**

  A computing arithmetic term that ‚Äúrefers to the fact that the radix point of an integer with a fixed precision (called the significand) can ‚Äúfloat‚Äù anywhere to the left, right, or between the significant digits of the number.

   

  # **footprint**

  Use of ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù is acceptable when referring to the amount of space occupied. This amount might be literal, in the case of hardware that takes up physical space, or figurative, referring to the number of compute resources required by an application. (For example: ‚ÄúApplications well-suited for public cloud typically require a small storage footprint.‚Äù)

  Do not use ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù to mean ‚Äútechnology,‚Äù ‚Äúenvironment,‚Äù ‚Äúuse,‚Äù ‚Äúinvestment,‚Äù ‚Äústrategy or approach,‚Äù or ‚Äúpresence or market.‚Äù

| When referring to | Consider using | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| a mix of hardware, software, or both | technology | These applications will span multiple infrastructure **technologies**‚Äîacross cloud providers and customer datacenters and multiple Kubernetes clusters. |
| where applications run | environment | Each of these four IT **environments**‚Äîbare metal, virtual machines, private clouds, and public clouds‚Äîbetter serve particular apps. |
| the size or scope of an organization‚Äôs use of a technology or product | use, investment | The company has expanded its cloud **use** from fewer than 800 workloads to more than 4,000.Public cloud **investments** are growing. 82% of tech professionals expect to increase funding in the next two years. |
| measures that demonstrate an organization‚Äôs priorities | strategy, approach | Sapphire is evolving their automation **strategy** to include network automation, compliance management, and more. |
| the size or scope of business activities | presence or market | Companies needed to deliver goods and services to customers without a set brick-and-mortar **presence**. |

  

  # **fortnight**

  A period of two weeks (14 nights). Do not use. This term is not common in American English and may also be unfamiliar to non-native speakers.


  # **forward, forward compatibility** {#forward,-forward-compatibility}

  Don‚Äôt use "forwards" or ‚Äúforwards compatibility.‚Äù If you are discussing future compatibility of Red Hat solutions, first get approval from Legal and use extreme caution. Language like this can promise future actions that may be legally binding.

  Examples:

* Looking forward to Q2, we will plan our budget and hiring as a team.

* We are considering this product‚Äôs forward compatibility with others in the Red Hat portfolio.

  See also [backward, backward compatibility](#backward,-backward-compatibility); [future-proof](#future-proof).


  # **frame it up**

  Jargon. Avoid. (Note: Particularly for United States audiences, this term is very similar to "frame-up," the act of providing false evidence or testimony to incriminate someone.)


  # **free** 

  Per Red Hat Legal: If something is being offered free of charge (or with synonyms like gratis, at no cost, complimentary), it is fine to use the term "free"; however, if someone is required to give us their email, contact information, or both to get something free, then at the time they provide that info, they must have the opportunity to opt out from giving us permission to use their personal info for marketing purposes.

  Consider these substitutions: at no cost (example: "an assessment at no cost" or as an adjective: "a no-cost assessment")

  üõà Exception: Avoid using "free" in email because it is a spam trigger in many email applications. Other substitutions to consider in email: complimentary, without charge, without cost, courtesy of Red Hat. 


  # **frictionless** {#frictionless}

  Do not use. This term is (a) jargon and (b) inaccurate. Nothing is ever really frictionless. Instead, talk about actual improvement in speed or time. 

  See also [seamless](#seamless).


  # **front end (n.); front-end (adj.)** 

  Do not hyphenate when the phrase does not precede a noun.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ in a front-end application.

* ‚Ä¶ when deploying to an application‚Äôs front end or back end.


  # **FTP**

  File transfer protocol. You may actually need to refer to SFTP, secure file transfer protocol. 

  üõà Use "ftp" when referring to the command-line program.

   

  # **fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD)**

  Avoid using fear to encourage individuals to work with Red Hat or use our products. We should help customers with problems they face, not introduce new potential problems. 


  # **function** {#function}

  In technical content, if referring to fundamental coding constructs, a function is lightweight code used for quick math, formatting, or logic. Example: 

  *"From the command line, key in the "xinput" function to see a list of all peripheral input devices connected to your hardware."* 

  See also [functionality](#functionality), [method](#method), [methodology](#methodology).


  # **functionality** {#functionality}

  Refers to the range of operations that can be run by a system. Example: 

  *"Red Hat Runtimes supports load-balancing and autoscaling functionality."* 

  See also [function](#function), [method](#method), [methodology](#methodology).


  # **future-proof** {#future-proof}

  Jargon. It's impossible and dishonest to claim that any of our products are "future-proof." We all have imperfect knowledge of the future and should be honest about the inevitability of change. 

  Suggested replacements: future-ready, ready for the future, prepared for the future.

  See [forward, forward compatibility](#forward,-forward-compatibility).

  # **hardened (adj.)**

  Do not use as a general descriptor for Red Hat's software development model or to describe the value of a Red Hat subscription. Use this term in the context of security (for example, reducing the attack surface by enhancing code and fixing vulnerabilities). If used in other contexts, add a qualifier. Always add a descriptive phrase to explain‚Äîfor example, "hardened for security" or "hardened for stability." 

  See also [productize (v.)](#productize-\(v.\)); [secure, secures, security](#secure,-secures,-security).

(Related: Refer to [The 3 Cs of Adjectives](https://source.redhat.com/departments/marketing/marketing-content-team/content_tips/content_tips_blog/content_tip_7_the_3_cs_of_adjectives) for examples of complex, coordinate, and cumulative adjectives and how to treat each.) 

  * Examples: "cloud-based solutions," "well-defined approach," ‚Äúblack-and-white photography‚Äù

    * Even when the compound adjective includes a numeral or ordinal: ‚Äú2-word phrase,‚Äù ‚Äú1st-time buyer‚Äù

    * üõà Exceptions: 

      * We don‚Äôt hyphenate "open source," "hybrid cloud," ‚Äúpublic cloud,‚Äù ‚Äúprivate cloud,‚Äù ‚Äúopen hybrid‚Äù (as in ‚Äú[open hybrid cloud](#bookmark=id.hw9rprspeqsy)‚Äù). 

      * Never hyphenate compound words that include the adverb ‚Äúvery‚Äù or adverbs ending in "ly." Examples: "A highly available system,‚Äù ‚Äúa very good time.‚Äù (We do hyphenate compound words that include words ending in ‚Äú-y,‚Äù such as, ‚Äúindustry-standard technology.‚Äù) 

* **Compound verbs.**

  * Examples: ‚ÄúShe speed-walked her way to victory.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe spoon-fed the baby.‚Äù

  * üõà Exception: Don‚Äôt use a hyphen in phrasal verbs (a verb combined with an adverb, a preposition, or both). For example, write ‚Äúback up the car,‚Äù not ‚Äúback-up the car.‚Äù See also: [back up (v.), backup (n., adj.)](#back-up-\(v.\);-backup-\(n.-or-adj.\)), [start up (v.), startup (n., adj.)](#start-up-\(v.\),-startup-\(n.-or-adj.\))

* **To avoid ambiguity.** 

  * Examples: "He recovered his health. He re-covered the leaky roof."

* **Prefix words that result in duplicated vowels and tripled consonants.** 

  * Hyphenate prefix words when the prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. Examples: "semi-independent," "anti-intellectual"

  * Hyphenate prefix words when the prefix ends in a double consonant and the word that follows begins with the same consonant. Example: ‚Äúcross-sell‚Äù

  * üõà Exceptions: "cooperate," "coordinate," and most double-e combinations like ‚Äúpreempt‚Äù and ‚Äúreelect‚Äù

* **Double prefixes.** 

  * Examples: "sub-subparagraph," "re-sublet"

* **Capitalized words with a prefix.** 

  * Examples: "un-American," "non-British"

  We usually do *not* hyphenate:

* **Compound adjectives that appear *after* a noun.** 

  * Examples: 

    * ‚ÄúOur solutions are cloud based.‚Äù 

    * ‚ÄúTheir approach is well defined.‚Äù 

    * ‚ÄúHis photographs are mostly black and white.‚Äù

  * üõà Exceptions (assuming you can‚Äôt rephrase): 

    * Use a hyphen when the compound word could be unclear. Examples: ‚ÄúThe test was both multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe issue is thought-provoking.‚Äù Without the hyphen, one might interpret this to mean the issue is thought of as provoking. (Source: [IBM Style](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=punctuation-hyphens#compound-words))

* **Words that begin with prefixes.** Examples: "multicloud," "nonnegotiable," "subpar," "copilot," "semiprivate," "predetermined," "reboot,‚Äù ‚Äúoutranked‚Äù (except for most [prefix words that result in duplicated vowels or tripled consonants](#bookmark=id.ke6blfrr9lkw)).

  * üõà Exception:

    * Prefixes that generally require hyphens include ‚Äúself-,‚Äù ‚Äúall-,‚Äù ‚Äúex-,‚Äù and ‚Äúhalf-.‚Äù

  # **inclusive language** {#inclusive-language}

  [In a blog post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language), Red Hat Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Chris Wright affirms our commitment to identify and replace problematic language that is potentially divisive and does not foster inclusion. To that end, follow these guiding principles:

* Do not use the terms ‚Äúwhite‚Äù or "black" in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad, such as ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù and ‚Äúblacklist.‚Äù Such usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias.

* For alternatives, choose words that describe the action that is taken or the function that is performed, rather than a metaphor for that action or function, for example ‚Äúallowlist‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwhitelist,‚Äù or ‚Äúblocklist‚Äù or ‚Äúdenylist‚Äù instead of ‚Äúblacklist.‚Äù

* Do not use "master" when it is paired with "slave." Such use diminishes the horror of the dehumanizing practice of slavery. Use of ‚Äúmaster‚Äù is acceptable in other contexts, such as to refer to mastery of a skill.

* Avoid gender bias. As an example, do not assume that the subject of a sentence is male if the context might refer to any gender. Thus, instead of using "man hours," use "labor hours" or "person hours."

* Avoid binary gendered language, such as ‚Äúhe‚Äù or ‚Äúshe,‚Äù except to refer to a specific named person. Do not use ‚Äúhe or she.‚Äù Instead, use the ungendered ‚Äúthey‚Äù as the preferred pronoun.

* Avoid neurodiversity bias. For example, avoid the terms "sanity check" and "sanity test," and do not use "disabled" to refer to a person.

* Avoid superlatives in job titles and descriptions, especially problematic terms such as ‚Äúguru,‚Äù "ninja," "rockstar," or "evangelist."

  # **JBoss way** {#jboss-way}

  We no longer capitalize this phrase. Prior to 2020, when referring specifically to the JBoss cultural and business climate or practices as the subject of your sentence, "the JBoss Way" was capitalized as a formal, branded concept. However, as descriptive phrases are generally not capitalized, this led to confusion and inconsistency. With consideration for how we handle other similar phrases ("open source way") and our capitalization policies in general, we now use this as a descriptive phrase per usual practices. 

  See also [open source way](#open-source-way), [Red Hat way](#red-hat-way).

   

  # **job titles** {#job-titles}

  # **leverage (n., v.)**

  Jargon (unless you have a rock and a board and are using them to create a physical lever). Also used in less-savory contexts, like blackmail. Avoid if possible; instead, try "use" or "take advantage of."

   

  # **lifecycle (n., adj.)**

  While we previously used ‚Äúlife cycle‚Äù to match contractual legal agreements, we now use ‚Äúlifecycle‚Äù: one word, not hyphenated even as a complex adjective. This change helps avoid confusion for writers and provide a more consistent content experience by aligning with the *IBM Style Guide* and the [Red Hat Technical Writing Style Guide](https://stylepedia.net/style/6.2/) used in product names and documentation.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ for a more efficient application lifecycle \[noun\]

* ‚Ä¶ for comprehensive lifecycle analytics \[adjective\]

   

  # **lights on (n.), lights-on (adj.)**

  Jargon that is typically used to mean "maintaining the status quo" or just doing what's required to keep things up and running (versus being proactive and innovative)‚Äîfor example, "A cloud can deliver strategic advantages to the business by redirecting resources from lights-on to innovation."

  Use "can" to describe actions or conditions that are possible. Use "may" to describe situations where permission is being given.

   

  # **megabit (Mb), megabyte (MB)** {#megabit-(mb),-megabyte-(mb)}

  Not interchangeable; data communication speed is measured in bits/kilobits/megabits per second, while storage space is measured in bytes/Kilobytes/Megabytes.

* 1 megabyte (MB) \= 8 megabits (Mb)

* 1 MB \= 1,000,000 or 1,048,576 bytes, depending on the context.

See also [MBps](#mbps).

# **military-grade (adj.)**

This description is used only when discussing government or military security requirements. If used in this way, link to [https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071](https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071) in the citation. Do not use to describe generic security or to emphasize security. Do not use "military-class security." When speaking of military or generic security, be as specific about the type or grade of security used as possible.

# **mission-critical (adj.)** {#mission-critical-(adj.)}

Mission-critical software is essential to executing on the core reason an organization exists. Systems that are important to or support the core mission aren‚Äôt necessarily mission-critical, even if they have a significant impact due to poor performance, frequent outages, etc. For example, administrative systems, marketing dashboards, and email systems are not commonly considered mission-critical. When mission-critical systems fail, the impact on the organization is often immediate and always severe. Mission-critical software can include customer-facing software for ensuring safety and regulatory compliance and core backend systems, such as databases and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. 

Historically, the phrase was often used in the context of the military or space exploration, but today it‚Äôs commonly used as jargon‚Äîdescribing anything that is important to a company, regardless of its risk or severity. And, of course, many modern organizations also have a mission statement, and that can contribute to the confusion.

What more precisely constitutes mission-critical software varies by organization and depends on their application and automation choices. Processing financial transactions without downtime is probably mission-critical to a bank; it may not be as critical to a hospital, relative to patient care and survival. Given inevitable downstream effects on an organization‚Äôs ability to continue to accomplish its core mission, Red Hat considers software mission-critical if it‚Äôs essential to preventing major loss or sustaining health and safety, data or software security, or regulatory compliance.

There are gray areas. But the key question to ask is whether a failure will produce a grave immediate or lasting effect on the organization or a specific objective of the organization, as opposed to being more of a transitory, though significant, inconvenience.

It‚Äôs probably mission-critical if:

* It risks life, health, or safety.

* It affects customers directly in a way that can cause harm literally or reputationally.

* An essential piece of software or infrastructure is unavailable.

* Something expensive broke, and it‚Äôs costing you a lot of money right now.

  Examples:

| Critical | Not critical |
| :---- | :---- |
| Flight-tracking systems are down; planes might crash into each other or the ground. | Flight entertainment systems are down. Passengers are bored and angry. |
| Banking transactions are not going through; customers cannot access their money or investments. | A bank‚Äôs website is unavailable for routine maintenance or an unexpected (but within SLA) outage. |
| A customer-service organization is experiencing a communications outage; customers cannot call or send support requests. | A customer-service organization‚Äôs internal chat system is down but not directly affecting customers. |
| A data breach at a healthcare company has made personal health and financial information of its patients public. | A health insurance company‚Äôs project management tool is down leading to non-customer-facing delays. |


  üõà **Note:** This entry significantly changed and expanded in Q2 2024\. 

  **Why are we changing our guidance?** We are currently experimenting with ‚Äúmission-critical‚Äù as part of a marketing campaign for automation topics.

  **How is guidance changing?**

* ‚ÄúMission-critical‚Äù still applies to truly critical mission-driven efforts, such as in military or medical settings (but not limited to military or medical scenarios).

* Our automation campaign may experiment with language here and choose to test ‚Äúmission-critical‚Äù as an adjective for some of its audiences.

  Subsequent references can be "Thunderbird."

   

  # **multi-**

  Do not hyphenate words with the prefix "multi" unless the dictionary or this guide says otherwise. Examples: "multiprocessing," "multilingual," and "multicloud," but ‚Äúmulti-tenant.‚Äù

  # **.NET**

  When referring to Microsoft‚Äôs software framework. When writing URLs, use ‚Äú.net‚Äù.


  # **nameserver**

   

  # **namespace**


  **natural language processing (NLP)**

  Spell out on first reference. Do not hyphenate.


  # **net-net (adj.)**

  Jargon. Try "in summary," "the end result," or a similar common-language phrase instead.

   

  # **net-new (adj.)**

  Jargon. Avoid as much as possible.

   

  # **next-generation (adj.), next generation (n.)**

  Use to refer to something that doesn't exist yet but will exist in the future, such as, "the next generation of storage" or "preparing for next-generation data needs." If you're referring to something that currently exists, use a more accurate word, like "modern."


  # **niche focus**

  Business jargon. Avoid using this term; when needed, use "market segment," "intended market," or a similar term instead.

   

  # **non-**

  Do not hyphenate words with the prefix "non" unless the dictionary says otherwise. Examples: "nonaddictive," "nonabrasive," "nonalcoholic." 

  See also [hyphenation](#hyphenation).

   

  # **nonsecure, non-secure (adj.)**

  Do not use. Use "insecure" instead.

   

  # **NULL, null**

  When a command or value is stated, use "NULL." When stating that something is invalid or associated with zero/nothing, use "null."


  # **numbers** {#numbers}

  Use numerals for all numbers, including:

* Numbers under 10\.

* Decimals.

* Fractions.

* Large values (for example, 1 million or higher)\*.

* Measurements.

* Negative (for example, \-4).

* Percentages.

* Registers (for example, R1).

* Release versions (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7).

* Ranges (for example, 4-6 datacenters).

* Specific quantities out of a large quantity (for example, 5 of the 25 datacenters).

* Ordinals (for example, 2nd, 3rd, etc.). Refer to [ordinal numbers](#ordinal-numbers).

  Exceptions where you should spell out the number:

* When it precedes another number (for example, four 8-socket servers).

* When it begins a sentence. You can, however, begin a headline or heading with a numeral.

* When referring to ‚Äútwo-factor authentication.‚Äù Never use "2-factor authentication" or "2FA" in customer-facing content. Refer to [two-factor authentication](#bookmark=kix.goxbc8s51ob0).

* When making approximations (for example, thousands of Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest attendees).

* When the number is used in a script that will be read aloud and recorded.

* When ‚Äúone‚Äù is used as an indefinite, a pronoun, to refer to unspecified measures, and casually, per the AP Stylebook (for example, one at a time, one day we‚Äôll know, one-size-fits-all)

  This rule applies for all media, including:

* Collateral (marketing PDFs).

* Code.

* Headlines or titles (for example, 5 ways to improve automation).

* Event creative (for example, posters, t-shirts, postcards, signage, etc.).

* References to book sections (for example, chapter 3, table 5, page 11).

* HTML (including website content, emails, newsletters).

* Presentation slide decks. (Exception: If the deck notes will be recorded for audio, make sure the notes spell out the numerals.)

  Except:

* Press releases and corporate blog posts follow strict AP style, which spells out numerals under 10\.

* Documentation and technical publications follow Chicago style for numerals, which in nontechnical contexts advises spelling out whole numbers (cardinal and ordinal) from zero through one hundred and certain round multiples of those numbers, with some exceptions (see 9.4; 7.89, section 1; 13.44; and 9.3).

* Red Hat Customer Portal content has its own style standards, including the Red Hat supplementary style guide and IBM Style.

* Titles or quotations from other organizations‚Äô content or assets retain the owner‚Äôs style‚Äîeven if they do not match Red Hat‚Äôs style standards.

  A high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.

   

  # **object-oriented**

   

  # **OEM (original equipment manufacturer)**

   

  # **offline (adj.)**

  Can be used in technical contexts (to mean, not online), but avoid using to refer to conversations, as in, "Let's take this offline." If you're talking about something after a meeting, say "let's defer this discussion until after this meeting" or something similar.

   

  # **on-board (adj.), onboard (v.)**

  Use "onboard" as a verb only when necessary, such as in Human Resources (HR)/People team contexts.

   

  # **ongoing**

   

  # **online (adj.)**


  # **on-premise (adj.), on premise (adv.)**

  Substitute "on-site" or "in-house" (when speaking about physically present systems) or other, more specific locational detail whenever possible. Avoid the shortened form ‚Äúon-prem‚Äù because it lacks clarity and creates localization challenges. Do not hyphenate when the phrase does not precede a noun.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ in an on-premise environment.

* ‚Ä¶ when deploying on premise or in a cloud environment.

  üõà A note to those who have these feelings: ‚ÄúThis is WRONG. ‚ÄòOn-premises‚Äô is grammatically correct and ‚Äòon-premise‚Äô is not.‚Äù:

  Language changes over time. The meaning of ‚Äúon-premise(s)‚Äù is shifting. Datacenters and compute power are distributed in new and different ways that blur the lines because issues of location and ownership are increasingly complex. We have seen many stylistic changes like this over time, including the decapitalization of terms like ‚Äúweb‚Äù and ‚Äúinternet.‚Äù

  To make a decision based on data and information, we watch the style and standards trends with the Associated Press, Chicago Manual of Style, and IBM‚Äôs style council, as well as SEO trends, both in the wider world and on redhat.com specifically. The information that we‚Äôve gathered and interpreted shows that people are looking for ‚Äúon premise‚Äù or ‚Äùon-premise‚Äù more than 5 times more often than they are looking for ‚Äúon-premises‚Äù or ‚Äúon premises.‚Äù

  # **on site (adv.), on-site (adj.)**

  Do not hyphenate when the phrase does not precede a noun.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ in an on-site environment.

* ‚Ä¶ when deploying on site or in a cloud environment.

   

  # **on demand (adv.), on-demand (adj.)**

  Do not hyphenate when the phrase does not precede a noun.

  Example:

* ‚Ä¶ when deploying on-demand resources.

* ‚Ä¶ when deploying resources on demand.

  # **opcodes**

   

  # **open hybrid cloud**

  Do not capitalize this phrase. Do not put a comma or hyphen between "open" and "hybrid." We do not use a hyphen between "open‚Äù and "hybrid", even when used as a compound adjective. This is an exception to our guidance about [hyphenation](#hyphenation).

  Customers building an open hybrid cloud infrastructure can use our entire portfolio to build cloud environments, write applications, and maintain integrated management, governance, and workload portability. This term is quite high-level, so detail the features or functionality of an open hybrid cloud approach, specific to the topic. Do not assume that "open hybrid cloud," by itself, is understood.

  Open hybrid cloud technologies use open source and open standards to provide workload portability and interoperability across physical, virtual, private cloud, and public cloud infrastructures. Open hybrid cloud environments can span on-premise and public resources, but do not need to. An open hybrid cloud architecture encourages software-defined, cloud-native infrastructure, modern applications, and DevOps processes. It can connect new infrastructure and workloads to classic IT.

  # **OpenJDK**

  OpenJDK trademark is owned by Oracle with a fair-use clause (see OpenJDK Trademark Notice), so we must be very careful about how we use this term. Our SKU name is "Red Hat build of OpenJDK"; we cannot use "Red Hat OpenJDK" as it does not fall under fair use.

   

  # **open source (n., adj.)**

  We do not hyphenate ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù even when used as an adjective.

* Incorrect: ‚Ä¶ an open-source approach

* Correct: ‚Ä¶ an open source approach

   

  # **open source way** {#open-source-way}

  Do not capitalize. Descriptive. 

  See also [open source (n., adj.)](#bookmark=id.a07zura7l5z0), [JBoss way](#jboss-way), [Red Hat way](#red-hat-way).

   

  # **operating system (OS)**

   

  # **operator, Operator**

  When referencing the Red Hat container technology, use ‚ÄúRed Hat OpenShift operator‚Äù on first use, then you may use ‚ÄúOpenShift operator‚Äù on subsequent mentions. For the Kubernetes technology, use ‚ÄúKubernetes Operator‚Äù.

  See [upstream naming](#upstream-naming-\(community-projects,-technologies\)).


  # **OpEx** {#opex}

  Financial term. Short for ‚Äúoperating expenses‚Äù.

  See also [CapEx](#capex). 

   

  # **Oracle Database 11*i***

  The "i" is italicized.


  # **ordinal numbers** {#ordinal-numbers}

  Write ordinal numbers using numerals (for example, ‚Äú1st,‚Äù ‚Äú2nd,‚Äù ‚Äú3rd,‚Äù ‚Äú15th,‚Äù ‚Äú100th‚Äù). Do not use superscript letters (for example, ‚Äú1st,‚Äù ‚Äú2nd,‚Äù ‚Äú3rd,‚Äù ‚Äú15th,‚Äù ‚Äú100th‚Äù). 

  Exceptions:

* In all content, spell out large-value ordinals (for example, ‚Äúmillionth‚Äù and higher).

* Spell out ordinals when they begin a sentence. (However, ordinals written using numerals are fine at the beginning of a headline or heading.)

* Spell out ordinals when they are used in a script or deck notes that will be read aloud and recorded.

* Press releases and corporate blog posts follow strict AP style, which spells out ordinals under 10\.

* Documentation and technical publications follow Chicago style for numerals, which in nontechnical contexts advises spelling out whole numbers (cardinal and ordinal) from zero through one hundred and certain round multiples of those numbers, with some exceptions (see 9.4; 7.89, section 1; 13.44; and 9.3).

* Red Hat Customer Portal content has its own style standards, including the [Red Hat supplementary style guide](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/) and the [IBM Style Guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style).

* Titles or quotations from other organizations‚Äô content or assets retain the owner‚Äôs style‚Äîeven if they do not match Red Hat‚Äôs style standards.

  # **orientate**

  Do not use. A user becomes "oriented" to an environment.


  # **over**

  When referring to something quantifiable, use "more than" instead.

  See also [undercloud](#undercloud-\(n.\)).


  # **override**

  # **packet-switching paradigm (n.)**

  Jargon. Instead, try "model," "standard," "norm," etc. 


  

  # **partner (v.), partnering (n.)**

  Per the Legal team, we should only reference partnering with an organization if that organization is a Red Hat partner, such as an independent software vendor (ISV). Otherwise, use engage/engaging with, collaboration/collaborating with, or a similar alternative.


  # **pattern**

  A replicable set of steps that's been used‚Äîand is relatively well-known‚Äîas a solution to an industry problem. It can also refer to software architecture if used in material targeting a technical audience. 

  üõà **Note:** "pattern" and "approach" are not interchangeable. The key difference between pattern and approach in software is in their relationship to design; pattern \= a more structured set of entities and relationships between them that has been specifically designed to solve a problem.


  # **pc, PC**

  When referring to "program counter," use "pc" after spelling out the acronym on first use. When referring to a general computer, use "PC."


  # **percent (%)** {#percent-(%)}

  Use the percent sign (%) whenever referring to numerical percentages. Example: "In a survey, 60% of users said they were satisfied with their technology solution."

  üõà Exceptions: Press releases and press blogs follow strict AP style, which spells out "percent" in all uses. 


  # **peer-to-peer architecture** 


  # **performant (adj.)**

  In the technical industry, this term means "performs as expected" or "well-performing." But it's not necessarily a word everyone knows (and technically, it means "a performer," as in a play, according to most dictionaries). Use an alternative if possible; otherwise, provide context.


  # **Perl**


  # **personas** {#personas}

  Personas, though they describe job roles, are not job titles and are not capitalized. To give emphasis to a persona in text or presentations, use bold styling. Example: 


  *In today's organizations, Red Hat Services works alongside **enterprise architects** to develop and execute a holistic plan and technical roadmap.*


See also [capitalization](#capitalization).

# **physicalize (v.)**

Often misused jargon that technically means "to interpret in a physical manner, or using physical concepts, such as expressions using body movements." If you're talking about "taking ideas from concept to reality," say so. Describe what you're actually doing to make concepts or data part of the physical plane of existence.

# **plain text**

# **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** {#platform-as-a-service-(paas)}

See also [as-a-Service](#as-a-service).

üõà  **Note:** Do not refer to OpenShift as a PaaS. Use "container application platform" or describe what it does, rather than what it is.

# **please**

Do not use.

# **pluggable** 

# **plug-in (n.), plug in (v.)**

As a noun, "plug-in" is a hardware or software module that adds a specific feature or service to a larger system.

Examples:

* ‚Ä¶ a better way to plug in the computer.

* ‚Ä¶ installing Red Hat OpenShift plug-ins.

  # **piggyback (v.)**

Jargon. In the technical industry, this term means "using another person's wireless network signal to gain Internet access without their knowledge or consent." If that's not what you mean, and the context isn't clear, use "add onto," "expand on," or a similar phrase instead.

# **pop-up**

# **PostScript**

A page description language and dynamically typed, stack-based programming language. 

# **PowerPC**

Do not use "PPC" or variants.

# **POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX)**

# **price/performance** {#price/performance}

Acceptable to use because it is a ratio that is difficult to describe succinctly.

# **private cloud (n., adj.)**

Always write as two words. Do not hyphenate when used as a complex adjective.

Examples:

* ‚Ä¶ in a private cloud environment. 

* ‚Ä¶when deploying to a private cloud.

  # **productize (v.)** {#productize-(v.)}

Not a word. Often used to mean "modifying something to become suitable as a commercial product" (per Wiktionary). Instead, describe how a product or open source project was secured, tested, and enhanced for production use.

# **product names**

**General:**

* Reference the [official Red Hat product names list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLS_lS3VKidgZIvcLmLp9BoiqptkvqHWfe1D5FD2kfk/edit?usp=sharing).

* Product names are not translated. Use the English language product name for all mentions.

* Do not use ‚Äúthe‚Äù before product names (Example: Do not use ‚Äúthe Red Hat OpenStack¬Æ Platform‚Äù‚Äîjust say "Red Hat OpenStack Platform")

* Refer to the [acronyms & abbreviations](#bookmark=id.rtmtazdkjvs1) entry for more information on using product name short forms and acronyms.

* Although some products or components may appear to be plural, they are often singular. Refer to the [official Red Hat product names list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DLS_lS3VKidgZIvcLmLp9BoiqptkvqHWfe1D5FD2kfk/edit?usp=sharing) descriptions for helpful context. Examples:

  * ‚ÄúRed Hat OpenShift Pipelines‚Äù ends in a plural, but it‚Äôs one platform that can be used to manage multiple pipelines, so it‚Äôs treated as a singular noun. (‚ÄúRed Hat OpenShift Pipelines is ‚Ä¶‚Äù)

  * ‚ÄúRed Hat Cloud Services‚Äù is a (single) family of multiple cloud services, so it‚Äôs treated as a singular noun. (‚ÄúRed Hat Cloud Services includes ‚Ä¶‚Äù)

    
    **Product name changes:**

* When product names change, reference the former name for one year after the name change is publicly announced for general availability (GA).

* If writing content referring to the product version with the former name, after the name change: "Red Hat Super Widget (now known as Red Hat Super DUPER Widget)"

* If writing content referring to version of the product after the name change: "Red Hat Super DUPER Widget (formerly Red Hat Super Widget)"


  **Line breaks:**

* If product names stretch to multiple lines, they should be broken up by the following components:   
  *Primary brand (Red Hat) | Sub-brand (Ceph, OpenShift, etc.) | Descriptor (Container Platform, Application Services, etc.) | Modifier (Beta, Add-on, etc.).* 

* In HTML content, at the very least, keep "Red Hat" together even if keeping the other components together isn't possible. 

* Do not break the last word and the version number across lines.

* Do not break words in product names, such as Ansible or OpenShift, across lines.

  # **proof of concept**

  To pluralize:

* Use "proofs of concept" when there are multiple proofs, only one concept.  
* Use "proofs of concepts" when there are multiple proofs and multiple concepts.

  Do not use "proof of concepts."


  # **pseudo-ops** 

  Per IBM, ‚Äúan instruction to the assembler that does not generate any machine code. The assembler resolves pseudo-ops during assembly, unlike machine instructions, which are resolved only at runtime.‚Äù

  # **public cloud (n., adj.)**

  Always write as two words. Do not hyphenate when used as a complex adjective.

  Examples:

* ‚Ä¶ in a public cloud environment. 

* ‚Ä¶when deploying to a public cloud.

  # **pulldown**

  üõà Exceptions: In technical publications, the IBM Style Guide specifies the form "pull-down (adj.)" but only to specify the type of menu or list.

  # **push-button automation, turnkey automation**

  Metaphorical language (literally, push a button or turn a key to begin automation) and difficult to translate. Often used to refer to easy/hands-off automation, but human intervention is required, so this use is not accurate.

  Instead, use language accurate to the situation being described, such as:

* User-triggered automation.

* Ready-to-use/ready-to-deploy.

* Self-service/self-provisioned.

* Single-step automation.

* On-demand automation.

  If you must use "turnkey," spell it as a single word without a hyphen ("turnkey" not "turn-key").

  # **Q and A, Q\&A**

  Can be singular or plural depending on use:

* ‚Äúquestion-and-answer (Q and A) session‚Äù

* ‚Äúwith questions and answers (Q and A) at the end‚Äù


  As with other initialisms, spell out the full term on the first or only instance. 

  Use the word ‚Äúand‚Äù in most instances for clarity. If space is limited, you may use ‚ÄúQ\&A,‚Äù but avoid other representations, like ‚ÄúQ+A.‚Äù 

  üõà **Note:** Keep in mind that symbols may not be universally shared, and that ampersands are not commonly used in Chinese, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese language materials. For these translated materials, if an ampersand is used, it will be replaced with ‚Äúand.‚Äù


  # **quotation marks**

  In American English, commas, periods, question marks, and exclamation marks go inside the quotation marks. Semicolons, colons, and dashes go outside the quotation marks when they apply to the whole sentence. 

  Examples:

* "Put it in the ready-to-publish pile," said the editor.

* She considered him "low brow."

* He just screamed "No\!" at the crowd.

* Do you hear that "ruckus?"

  There are exceptions to this rule:

* The semicolon and dash go inside the quotation marks when they apply to the quoted matter only. Examples: 

  * Paul saw an argument coming, so he muttered only ‚ÄúBut I saw it;‚Äù this was going to be a long night and he didn‚Äôt want to start it with a fight.

  * Paul thought "I'm so angry I could‚Äî" but died before he could complete his thought.

  For quotation marks within quotation marks, the inner quotation marks should be single quotation marks and the other ones should be regular quotation marks. Examples:

* ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Dementor‚Äôs Kiss‚Äô is my favorite chapter in the whole series,‚Äù Tom said.

* "She asked, 'Where's the beef?'"

  Use "said" or "says" for quote attributions. Other words like "exclaimed" or "noted" get in the way of the quote itself and tend to editorialize. Example: "Truth happens," said Withera.

  # **reach out (v.)** {#reach-out-(v.)}

  Metaphor. The only reason to reach out is to do something, so just do it. Don't "reach out and discuss," just "discuss." Be descriptive: "Email us for more information" instead of "reach out for more information." Describe how you will next contact someone: "I'll call you next Thursday afternoon" instead of "I'll reach out." See circle back.


  # **read-only**


  # **read/write**


  # **real-time (adj.), real time (n.)**

  Examples:

* ‚Ä¶ for real-time applications.

* ‚Ä¶ updating Red Hat OpenShift in real time.


  # **reboot**


  # **recursive**


  # **Red Hat**

  Write "Red Hat" not "Red Hat, Inc." The only exceptions to this rule are legal or financial statements.

  Do not separate "Red" from "Hat" on different lines when writing the company name or the name of our products. "Red Hat" should always be on the same line. When possible, also keep product names together; if needed, break after "Red Hat."

  Product names should be broken by the following components: *Primary brand (Red Hat) | Sub-brand (Ceph, OpenShift, etc.) | Descriptor (Container Platform, Application Services, etc.) | Modifier (Beta, Add-on, etc.)*. Do not break words in product names, such as Ansible or OpenShift, across lines.

  A company is singular in the U.S. In other words, Red Hat is an "it," not a "they."


  # **Red Hat way** {#red-hat-way}

  We no longer capitalize this phrase. Prior to 2020, when referring specifically to Red Hat cultural and business climate or practices as the subject of a sentence, "the Red Hat Way" was capitalized as a formal, branded concept. However, as descriptive phrases are generally not capitalized, this led to confusion and inconsistency. With consideration for how we handle other similar phrases ("open source way") and our capitalization policies in general, we now use this as a descriptive phrase per usual practices. 

  See also [JBoss way](#jboss-way), [open source way](#open-source-way).


  # **regardless**

  Even though "irregardless" is a valid word, its use is rather specific and dialectal. It's not part of "standard English" and should not be used in formal speech or writing.


  # **regional spelling**

  Use U.S. spelling for English-language collateral and most global corporate content. In regional content, customer stories, or in materials targeted for a regionally specific audience, regional English spelling may be used for authenticity or by request of the customer/partner. 


  # **rest on your laurels (v.)**

  Idiom. Avoid using. This phrase refers to when someone focuses on what they've already achieved, rather than additional effort. "The origins of the phrase lie in ancient Greece, where laurel wreaths were symbols of victory and status. ... Apollo embraced the tree, cut off a branch to wear as a wreath and declared the plant sacred. Their belief in the myth caused the Greeks to present laurel wreaths to winners in the Pythian Games." (per The Phrase Finder).


  # **roadmap**


  # **roundtable (n. or adj.)**

  Type of event or gathering (not to be confused with a circular table: round table).


  # **RPM**

  Recursive acronym for RPM Package Manager (originally Red Hat Package Manager). Use full name on first mention to clarify and avoid confusion with the common term ‚Äúrotations per minute).


  # **runlevel**


  # **runtime**

  # **(s)**

  As in "service(s)." Do not use except in the rare instance when needed for specificity or clarity‚Äîor better yet, rewrite to avoid.


  # **S-record**

  A file format created by Motorola in the mid-1970s that conveys binary information as hex values in ASCII text form. Also referred to as SREC.


  # **Samba**

  A free software re-implementation of the SMB networking protocol that provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients. 


  # **sanity check, sanity test**

  Do not use. This term might be derogatory to neurodiverse people. Jargon, such as "sanity check," is difficult to translate and understand for readers whose first language is not English. Instead, explain exactly what you mean. For example, use "validate" or "verify." 

  See also [inclusive language](#inclusive-language).


  # **screenshot**


  # **scrollbar**


  # **seamless** {#seamless}

  Do not use. This term is inaccurate jargon and an outdated (circa 2015\) analyst term. Instead, be descriptive and talk about actual improvement: use "uninterrupted," "simpler," or a similar alternative. In the context of, "a seamless user experience," one of these might work: "consistent," "unified," or "interoperable." In the context of, "a seamless transition between systems," one of these might work: "undetectable," "unnoticeable," or "imperceptible." 

  See also [frictionless](#frictionless).


  # **secure, secures, security** {#secure,-secures,-security}

  ‚ÄúSecure‚Äù is an absolute. We cannot claim something is ‚Äúsecure‚Äù or ‚Äúmore secure‚Äù.  We cannot make claims that any system or environment is or will be ‚Äúsecure.‚Äù Even when paired with adjectives like ‚Äúmore‚Äù or ‚Äúimproved,‚Äù you must provide verifiable data that proves improvements or superiority. You can claim that security will be improved IF AND ONLY IF you have quantifiable data to support that conclusion.

  In almost all cases, use of the term ‚Äúsecure‚Äù is a poor substitute for (accurately) describing specific elements or features of the product or service that promote trustworthiness and resiliency.

  For our audiences, security is a top concern across all types of environments and levels of organizational maturity. A growing focus on managed services places more responsibility on vendors like Red Hat to clearly communicate and manage security policies, practices, and promises. The reputational risk from exaggerating (either intentionally or unintentionally) what we can deliver with regards to security is quite high, as vulnerabilities and exploits are both inevitable and newsworthy. A high-profile security breach can have devastating consequences for both customers and vendors, and those consequences can be greatly amplified if the vendor has misstated or misrepresented their security profile or practices.

  There are also elements of significant legal risk. The focus on inaccurate or misleading cybersecurity claims is a major focus on enforcement authorities. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) (using Section 5 to pursue deceptive claims) or other government entities (e.g., under the False Claims Act) is scrutinizing misstatements and incomplete or inaccurate statements about the security of our offerings. 

  When talking about security, ask yourself:

* What is it about our solution/service that makes us feel that we can say it is secure?   That is what we need to be talking about, not a generic statement about security.

* Are there specific features, functionality, or qualities that provide security that you can describe in more detail?

* What steps were taken to protect against or resolve potential or incoming threats?

* If there is a security gain, what data or change in performance demonstrates or shows that improvement?

* Could any of the claims made be misinterpreted or understood as a promise about security that we cannot fulfill?

* Rather than making broad, hard-to-believe statements about ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù in general, we should be specific about the features, steps, or gains in ways that are less likely to be misinterpreted.

  # **segregation**

  Do not use. Use "separation" or "segmentation." This term refers to a process that violates human rights by limiting access to privileges and rights such as education and voting. 

  See also [inclusive language](#inclusive-language).


  # **SELinux**

  Use full term, "Security-Enhanced Linux," on first use, then "SELinux" on subsequent uses.


  # **semiweekly/semimonthly**

  Twice per week/month. Avoid using the prefixes bi- and semi-. People have trouble remembering if "biweekly" means "every two weeks" or "twice a week." "Semiweekly" has a similar problem. Instead of "semiweekly/semimonthly," write "twice a week/month."


  # **server side (n.), server-side (adj.)** {#server-side-(n.),-server-side-(adj.)}

  Examples:

* ‚Ä¶ installing applications on the server side.

* ‚Ä¶ installing server-side applications.


  # **service-oriented architecture (SOA)**


  # **service provider** {#service-provider}

  When referring to phone, internet, or other telecommunications services, the preferred term is "telecommunications service provider." 

  See also [communications service provider (CSP)](#communications-service-provider-\(csp\)), [telecommunications service provider](#telecommunications-service-provider).


  # **set up (v.), setup (n.), set-up (adj.)**

  To set up \[verb\] a computer, make sure to follow the set-up \[adj.\] process to successfully complete the setup \[n.\].


  # **shut down (v.)**

  Examples:

* ‚Ä¶ a better way to sign up.

* ‚Ä¶ a better way to complete the sign-up process.

* ‚Ä¶ a better way to complete sign-up.


  # **silo (n.), siloed (v.)**

  Metaphor. Do not use. Useful in farming (refers to a tall storage structure for grain or other crops) but in business, it's jargon. Try "isolated team structures," (or "standalone," "confined," or "separated"), or a phrase like "data held by one group" or "data not easily or fully accessible by other groups in the same organization."


  # **simply**

  Do not use. See also [basically](#basically).


  # **since**

  See [because](#because).


  # **skill set (n.)**

  Do not use. Use "skills" or "knowledge."


  # **slave**

  See [master/slave](#master/slave).


  # **smart card (n., adj.)**

  Always use the two-word form. Do not use "smart-card" or other variations. Do not capitalize unless it is part of a product name or other proper noun. Standard heading capitalization rules apply.

  Examples:

* A smart card is a type of hardware used to control access.

* Use the documentation to complete the smart card installation process.


  # **socket-pair (n.)**

  Because Red Hat Legal uses it this way in legal contracts. If used as a command, assume that normal command guidelines apply.


  # **soft copy**

  Do not use.


  # **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** {#software-as-a-service-(saas)}

  See [as-a-Service](#as-a-service).

  # **solutioning (v.)**

  Not a word; avoid using. Instead, use "creating a solution" or similar phrase.


  # **solutions-based (adj.)**

  Meaningless phrase. Be specific instead.


  # **solution stack (n.)**

  Jargon. Software is not always deployed in a clear, top-to-bottom structure; sometimes, it's more like a cloud or web than a stack of blocks. Use "configuration" or "combination" instead.


  # **sound card**


  # **space**

  Use when referring to the space character, such as "Ensure there is a space between each command." Use "spacebar" when referring to the keyboard key.


  # **space is limited** {#space-is-limited}

  Avoid using this phrase, as it often makes people feel like an organization is being unclear in an attempt to get people to commit to an event or sign up earlier. It can be perceived as false advertising. Instead, be clear about the quantity available‚Äîfor example: "Registration is limited to 100 registrants," or "You must register by October 3 to attend."

  See also [exclusive](#exclusive-\(adj.\)).


  # **spaces (using)**

  Use only one space between sentences. Do not use spaces around an em-dash (‚Äî).


  # **spec file**


  # **spend (n.)**

  Do not use ‚Äúspend‚Äù as a noun. Use "costs," "expenses," "expenditures," or "spending" instead.

  # **SQL**

  There are times when "SQL" is preceded by the article "a" or "an." If referring to a database, use "a SQL \_\_\_ " ("a sequel"). If referring to the language, use "an SQL \_\_\_\_\_" ("an es-queue-ell").


  # **squad, squad-of-squads, or squad of squads (n.)** {#squad,-squad-of-squads,-or-squad-of-squads-(n.)}

  Avoid. Use instead: ‚Äúteam,‚Äù or ‚Äúgroup.‚Äù 

  See also [team](#team,-team-of-teams,-or-team-of-teams-\(n.\)), [group](#group-\(n.\)), [tribe](#tribe-\(n.\)).


  # **standalone**


  # **start up (v.), startup (n. or adj.)** {#start-up-(v.),-startup-(n.-or-adj.)}

  To start up \[v.\] a computer, make sure to follow the startup \[adj.\] process to successfully complete the startup \[n.\].


  # **state names**

  Write out state names, even for cities allowed by AP to stand alone in datelines. Examples are Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest sites such as Boston, Massachusetts, and San Francisco, California.  If there is not room to spell out the state name, as in a character-limited design element, use the postal abbreviation (for example, San Francisco, CA).

  It is permissible to use the city alone in an email subject line (for example, ‚ÄúJoin us in Boston‚Äù) as long as the state name is provided with the city in the body of the email.

  You do not need to list the state name for the same city more than once in the same piece of content. For example, if you mention in the body of an email that Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest is in San Francisco, California, the email closing can be "We hope to see you in San Francisco" (without repeating the state name).


  # **stovepipe (n.)**

  Jargon. In business, related to lack of cross-organizational communication, similar to silo. Instead, just say "lack of communication."


  # **StudlyCaps**

  See [CamelCase](#camelcase).


  # **subdirectory**


  # **subhead**

  See [headlines](#headlines).


  # **submenu**


  # **superuser**


  # **swap space**


  # **synergy (n., adj.), synergical connectivity (n.)**

  Jargon. Try "cooperative," "working together," "collaborative," "harmonious," etc.


  # **system administrator**

  Use "system administrator" on first use. Subsequent use can be "sysadmin". "System" should be singular (that is, not "systems administrator"), because it can include both a single system and multiple systems, similar to "database administrator" or "brain surgeon," who work on more than one database and brain, respectively. When used as a job title, it should be spelled out and capitalized. 

  See also [job titles](#job-titles).


  # **SysV** 

  Unix System V is one of the first commercial versions of the Unix operating system.

  # **Taskbar**


  # **team, team-of-teams, or team of teams (n.)** {#team,-team-of-teams,-or-team-of-teams-(n.)}

  Use ‚Äúteam,‚Äù or ‚Äúgroup‚Äù to refer to people collectively. Avoid ‚Äúteam of teams‚Äù and ‚Äúteam-of-teams.‚Äù Use instead: ‚Äúmultiple teams‚Äù or describe the way the teams are combined clearly. 

  See also [group](#group-\(n.\)), [squad](#bookmark=id.j8vyh3rp4thc), [tribe](#tribe-\(n.\)).


  # **telco** {#telco}

  Use "telecommunications service provider" on first use. Subsequent uses can be "telco" or "telco service provider"; only use "telco" when the context makes it clear that the industry is engaged in providing telecommunications services. Use in URLs.

  See [telecommunications service provider](#telecommunications-service-provider).


  # **telecom** {#telecom}

  Do not use. Abbreviation for "telecommunications service provider." Do not use in URLs. 

  See also [telco](#telco), [telecommunications service provider](#telecommunications-service-provider).


  # **telecommunications service provider** {#telecommunications-service-provider}

  Preferred abbreviation is "telco,"but only after "telecommunications service provider" is referenced on first use. "Service provider" is an acceptable abbreviation after first use, but be careful in content that mentions different industries/types of services. Do not use in URLs. 

  See [telco](#telco), [telecom](#telecom).


  # **telephone numbers**

International phone number style: \+countrycode citycode local number.  
Examples:

* (US) \+1 919 754 4268  
* (Argentina) \+54 11 4329 7300

For consistency, it‚Äôs best to use spaces instead of hyphens or parentheses in numeric phone numbers.

To add accessibility context, use hyphens in between words in alphanumeric phone numbers and write out the corresponding numerals in parentheses after an alphanumeric number appears.   
Example:

* 888-RED-HAT-1 (888-733-4281)


  # **Telnet**

A client/server application protocol that provides access to virtual terminals of remote systems on local area networks or the internet. 

# **that/which**

"That" introduces a restrictive clause‚Äîa clause that must be there for the sentence to make sense. A restrictive clause often defines the noun or phrase preceding it.

* Example: ‚ÄúThe car was traveling at a speed that would endanger lives.‚Äù

  "Which" introduces a non-restrictive, parenthetical clause‚Äîa clause that could be omitted without affecting the meaning of the sentence. 

* Example: The car, which was traveling at a speed that would endanger lives, swerved onto the sidewalk.

  Use "who" when referring to individual persons.

* Example: The boy who stole your bike is at the door. 

  Use "that" or "which" for things. 

* Examples: "The carpet that you bought for the hallway is here." or "My carpet, which I bought for the hallway, is here."

  # **then/than**

"Then" refers to a time in the past or the next step in a sequence. "Than" is used for comparisons.

# **(think) outside the box**

This phrase is outdated jargon. We recommend "(think) creatively" or "(think) unconventionally" instead.

# **third-party (adj.), third party (n.)**

Examples:

* ‚Ä¶ when contacting third-party partners.

* ‚Ä¶ when considering whether or not to engage a third party.


  # **this**

  The word "this" can be used as an adjective or a pronoun. If you use it as a pronoun, be clear what the antecedent is. If it is unclear, use the adjective form by following "this" with a noun. Example: Change "This is ideal" to "This configuration is ideal."


  # **thrice**

  Avoid this term. Use "three times" instead.


  # **throughput** 


  # **tier-1**

  Never "tier-one."

  # **time** {#time}

  üõà **Note:** *This is a style change as of August 2021\. Our previous style for time used "a.m." and "p.m." but this switch aligns with design's needs (this was already an exception previously, for line-length in agendas and tables) and the style choices of our technical teams (who follow IBM style, which uses AM/PM), which brings better overall consistency.* 

  Time of day is written as "4 PM" or "4 AM" Remember to specify the time zone and the correct daylight status that‚Äôs in effect (for example, EST versus EDT). It‚Äôs also OK to use the 2-letter designation (for example, ET) as it defaults to whatever daylight status is in effect at that time.

  Include the time in 24-hour format in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) for global audiences when appropriate. This [time zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) lets writers enter the location, set the date (past, present, or future), and enter the time to be converted as well as click to include UTC in the results. Example: 1 PM ET (18:00 UTC)

  When you prepare a list or grid of times (in an agenda, schedule, or other signage‚Äïeither in print or digital copy), use the :00 format, spaces, and AM and PM, so that the list of times has the same number of characters and lines up neatly. This improves readability.

  Example event schedule:

| Incorrect | Correct |
| ----- | ----- |
|  Breakfast 7 \- 8:30 AM Lunch 11 AM \- 12:30 PM Dinner 5 \- 7 PM  |  Breakfast 7:00 AM \- 8:30 AM Lunch 11:00 AM \- 12:30 PM Dinner 5:00 PM \- 7:00 PM  |

  # **time frame**


  # **timeline**


  # **time to market (n.), time-to-market (adj.)**


  # **time zone**


  # **timeout**

  # **titles**

  If possible, use italics for book titles, magazines, newspapers (publications and periodicals), manuals; otherwise no treatment.

  Capitalize the main words of book titles, including prepositions and conjunctions of four or more letters, and verbs including "is" and "are."

  Use numerals for all numbers, even at the beginning of the title (for example, 5 ways to improve automation).

  Use quotation marks for titles of articles, papers, collateral, essays.

  When writing titles of non-Red Hat content:

* If a Red Hat document contains the title of content that is published by a third party, maintain the same capitalization style and numerical style used by the third party. (In other words, if the third party uses title case, use title case. If the third party spells out "five" instead of using "5," use "five.")

* If a Red Hat document refers to multiple titles of content published by multiple third parties, where one third party writes the title in title case and another third party writes the title in sentence case, in the Red Hat document, write all of the titles in sentence case. (Our Legal department has confirmed that we can't get into legal trouble for changing them like that.) Take the same action regarding numerical style.

* If we are requested by a third party to use a certain capitalization or numerical style, honor that request.

  In-text uses of titles that do not require a [footnote citation](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/word-nerds/red_hat_word_nerds_wiki/citation_style_guide) can be linked directly for non-print content. For print content, spell out the full URL: "The 2018 Red Hat report at redhatreport.com"

  üõà Exceptions: Only use the above treatments if the title is NOT being hyperlinked (because the hyperlink sets the title off enough).


  # **token-ring**


  # **toll-free number**

A toll-free, Freecall, Freephone, 800, 0800, or 1-800 number is identified by a dialing prefix similar to a geographic area code, such as 800\. (The specific service access numbers vary by country. Use the \+ sign only for international phone numbers, as it stands for 00.) In the U.S., at least, toll-free codes other than 800 include: 888, 877, 866, 855, 844, and 833\.

For consistency, it‚Äôs best to use spaces instead of hyphens or parentheses in numeric phone numbers.

To add accessibility context, use hyphens in between words in alphanumeric phone numbers and write out the corresponding numerals in parentheses after an alphanumeric number appears.   
Example:

* 888-RED-HAT-1 (888-733-4281)


  # **toolbar**


  # **tooltip** {#tooltip}

  Refers to a brief, plain text description that is displayed when a cursor is moved over a graphical image. Do not use "hover help."


  # **toward**

  As opposed to "towards".

  # **trademarks**

  **Symbols**

  Add a superscripted registered mark ¬Æ (nicknamed "r-ball") or trademark ‚Ñ¢ to the first body-copy instance of all protected terms listed in the [Copyright Notices and Trademark Legends guide](https://source.redhat.com/departments/legal/redhatintellectualproperty/trademarks/trademarks_and_domain_names_wiki/copyright_notices_and_trademark_legends). 

  Do not place the r-ball in a quote, heading, or a table of contents. If the only mention is in a sidebar, you can include an r-ball there, but the preference is to use the r-ball in the body copy.

  Do not include symbols for other companies' trademarks unless they are listed in the Copyright Notices and Trademark Legends guide (which means we have an agreement with them to honor their marks).

  Exceptions:

* Case studies and customer success stories get a r-ball in the left sidebar (software and services list) first, or in the body copy if the protected term is not listed there.

* If the first instance of a protected term is in a caption or figure label, add an r-ball there only if it's the only instance of the term; otherwise, add to the first non-caption use.

  **Symbols: Email use**

  In emails, follow the guidelines above, but keep these guidelines in mind:

* Do not include in a heading or in the signature: For example, do not use an r-ball if the email is signed ‚ÄúThe Red Hat team‚Äù and that's the only time Red Hat is used as an adjective.

* The most important factor in deciding whether to use r-balls is the look and tone of the email. Examples: An all-text (no HTML) event follow-up email from an individual ("Hi Jane, Thanks for joining us at Red Hat Summit and AnsibleFest last month...") would likely not use r-balls, but an email with HTML and a call-to-action button promoting the event to previous attendees‚Äîalso sent from an individual‚Äîwould likely use r-balls. If in doubt, check with an editor on the [Marketing Content Team](https://source.redhat.com/departments/marketing/marketing-content-team).

  **Disclaimers**

  Add the trademark disclaimer (copyright boilerplate) to all documents. Some trademarks, like OpenStack, may require additional copyright/trademark language. Refer to the [Copyright Notices and Trademark Legends guide](https://source.redhat.com/departments/legal/redhatintellectualproperty/trademarks/trademarks_and_domain_names_wiki/copyright_notices_and_trademark_legends).


  # **traditional IT** {#traditional-it}

  An IT infrastructure approach that generally includes physical hardware that is optimized for specific applications and resources. Can also be referred to as "mode 1," "type 1," or "classic." 

  See also [bimodal IT](#bimodal-it).


  # **tribe (n.)** {#tribe-(n.)}

  Avoid metaphoric use of this term, for example ‚Äúfind your tribe‚Äù or ‚Äújoin our tribe,‚Äù when not referring to an actual tribal group. Use only if you are talking about an actual Native American or other culturally appropriate tribal organization. Use instead: ‚Äúgroup,‚Äù ‚Äúteam,‚Äù ‚Äúgathering,‚Äù or ‚Äúassembly.‚Äù 

  See also [group](#group-\(n.\)), [squad](#squad,-squad-of-squads,-or-squad-of-squads-\(n.\)), [team](#team,-team-of-teams,-or-team-of-teams-\(n.\)).


  # **troubleshoot**


  # **tunnel vision**

  In optometry, refers to constriction of the visual field resulting in loss of peripheral vision. In business, this jargon phase is often used to mean "lack of foresight" or "possession of a narrow viewpoint." Use those instead (unless you're literally looking down a tunnel).


  # **two-factor authentication**

When referring to ‚Äútwo-factor authentication.‚Äù Never use "2-factor authentication" or "2FA" in customer-facing content.

# **type 1/type 2 (IT)(adj.)** {#type-1/type-2-(it)(adj.)}

A set of terms describing the 2 types of IT infrastructure: traditional (1) or cloud-native (2). Also known as mode 1/mode 2\.

See also [bimodal IT](#bimodal-it).

| [Back to top](#bookmark=id.wrqnzzq6cgua) |
| :---: |

# **under**

When referring to something quantifiable, use "fewer than."

# **undercloud (n.)** {#undercloud-(n.)}

Always lowercase. This is a concept, not a technology or product name. Being a common noun, this requires an article in most cases. 

See also [overcloud](#overcloud-\(n.\)).

# **units**

No space between value and unit. Example: "64GB" not "64 GB"

# **UNIX**

UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group. Do not use "UNIX-like." Use an expression like "Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems" instead.

# **upgrade**

# **upsell (v.)**

# **upstream naming (community projects, technologies)** {#upstream-naming-(community-projects,-technologies)}

**For technical materials:** 

Respect upstream use as much as possible, unless there is direct conflict with or causes confusion with Red Hat offerings. Where such conflict or confusion might exist, explain the difference in our content.

**For marketing and corporate materials:**  

* Always be honest about the relationship between community projects and Red Hat products. Calling modified code in a Red Hat product the same name as the community project is inaccurate. Use phrases to accurately indicate the relationship between Red Hat and the code being used, such as:  Red Hat's implementation of \[project name\].

* Capitalize other organization‚Äôs proper-noun names, when referring to their products or technologies.

  * DO NOT capitalize the names of features or components in Red Hat products, except for a few rare, compelling, or historical proper-noun names. Our usual practice is to only capitalize full product names.

  * Brand names like ‚ÄúClair‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuarkus‚Äù or ‚ÄúJBoss‚Äù are proper nouns. They should be capitalized along with language that makes clear their association or relationship to Red Hat (for example, Red Hat build of Quarkus).

  * Some organizations create proper-noun *descriptive* terms like ‚ÄúOperators.‚Äù To honor the upstream community/partner‚Äôs style guide while making it clear that this isn‚Äôt a Red Hat product or branded concept, we should associate the community and partner name with the capitalized descriptive phrase. For example: ‚ÄúKubernetes Operator.‚Äù\* 

  üõà ***Note:** Operators/operators is of particular concern because of the variable meaning of the term‚Äîit can be a mechanical operator or a human operator and context is required to define this clearly.) Example: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)*


  # **URLs** {#urls}

  For URLs that begin with "http://www," you may omit that portion and use the main URL, such as "redhat.com" or "opensource.com/business." If it begins with "ftp" or "https://," include the full URL. 

  For digital collateral assets, URLs can be used in footnotes and within the body text. For print collateral assets, spell out the full URL: "The 2018 Red Hat report at https://www.redhatreport.com/page/enter.html." Short URLs (like "partner.redhat.com") can be used in body copy at your discretion.

  Do not capitalize domain names, even when they begin a sentence (but try to avoid starting a sentence with a domain name). Example: "redhat.com is awesome." 

  üõà When writing a domain name that does not belong to Red Hat, adhere to that entity's capitalization. If you can't determine how they capitalize it, default to Red Hat's style. 

  Keep in mind that screen readers may have trouble speaking domain names with more than 1 word. Use good judgment in deciding how to write multiword domain names; if needed for clarity, use [CamelCase](#camelcase). 

  See also [capitalization](#capitalization).

  # **U.S. (adj.), United States (n.)**

  As a noun, use "United States" unless there are space constraints. As an adjective use "U.S." (for example, U.S. soldier). As part of an organization, use "U.S." For web, abbreviate "U.S." in all instances to save space, unless abbreviating would make it unclear.


  # **usable** 


  # **usage** {#usage}

  Instead, use ‚Äúuse‚Äù. For example, ‚Äúresource usage‚Äù can be shortened to ‚Äúresource use‚Äù.

  See also [consume](#consume-\(v.\)).


  # **user ID**

  Do not use "userid" or any other variation unless referring to a specific variable, parameter, or user interface (UI) label that uses a different form.


  # **user interface (UI)**

  # **username**

  For detailed case studies, use realistic, but not real names. In other words, do not use the name of an employee, a well-known person, your neighbor, and so on.

  In examples or scenarios, you can use a person's name and then use a gender-specific pronoun to refer to that name. Vary the use of proper names in documentation. Use names that represent various ethnic backgrounds, genders, and locations.

  Include a diverse set of names in your examples to reflect the diversity of the real world. For example, use male, female, and culturally diverse names that suggest a variety of backgrounds in examples to avoid implying that only certain groups have specific skills.

  For example, as the system administrator at Global Banking, you need to set up permissions to the accounting directory for a set of users. You could use the following example names: Huong Sabo, Jolene Paluch, Abby Quincy, Francis Ritcher, and Jaya Lamont.

  You can use any of the following name generators to create realistic names for users:

* [listofrandomnames.com](http://listofrandomnames.com/)

* [behindthename.com/random/](http://www.behindthename.com/random/)

* [random-name-generator.info](http://random-name-generator.info/)

  # **user space**


  # **utilize** {#utilize}

  Buzzword, jargon, and unnecessarily long. This term is a good example of overused business jargon that we try to avoid in favor of Red Hat‚Äôs clear and direct voice and tone. (Big words don't automatically make us sound smarter.) Save some time and space and say "use."

  See also [consume](#consume-\(v.\)), [usage](#usage).

  # **value add (n.), value-added (adj.)**

  Jargon. Avoid using. Just say "added value" or "valuable" or be more specific, such as, "adds value by improving productivity."


  # **VAR (value-added reseller)**


  # **verbiage, verbage (n.)**

  Means "an excess of words" and has negative connotations. Use "wording" or "language" instead. (Also, "verbage" is not a word, so don't use it.)


  # **versus**

  Always spell out "versus" unless space is limited (for example, graphic, title, web copy) in which case you can abbreviate to "vs." (not "vs").


  # **very (adj.)**

  Vague. There's not much value in saying "very cost-effective" versus "cost-effective." Avoid using.


  # **vi, Vim**

  A free and open source screen-based text editor program. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi. 


  # **virtual machine (VM)** {#virtual-machine-(vm)}

  Encapsulated version of an operating system. OK to abbreviate to "VM" as long as you've spelled it out once in first occurrence and as long as "VM" won't be confused with other terms that share that acronym. 

  See also host, guest.


  # **virtual, virtualized**

  "Virtual" is the preferred adjective. Use "virtualized" to indicate a component or concept previously existed in non-virtual (physical) form.

  üõà **Note:** We prefer to keep the American spelling of this word, even in documents that are for audiences that use British English spellings. This is to avoid the visual inconsistency of talking about your "virtualisation" with "Red Hat Virtualization." (Never change the product name spelling.)


  # **version numbers**

  The preferred format for product names includes only the major version number (for example, 5, 6, 7). Example: "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7". In a product name, do not break the last word and the version number across lines.

  Only use minor version numbers when writing about a product line, release, or family if referring to a specific minor release or feature within a specific minor release. Example: "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 was released on October 12, 2010." Use ".0" only when specifically referring to something that's different in that version from another version within that major version. Example: "The super widget in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1 replaces the basic widget that comes with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0." 

  üõà **Note:** In most cases, significant changes take place in major version releases and are carried through any minor versions. So when referring to a significant change or the first appearance of a new technology, it's usually accurate to refer to the major release.)

  We do not write out "version" or use "v1.2" style notation as part of our product names. If you need to use the word "version," rewrite so that it does not appear to be part of the product name.

  üõà **Note:** The above rules only apply to Red Hat products. Refer to partner's or competitor's product information to determine appropriate version numbers.

  # **Web 2.0**

  Avoid using this term.


  # **web** 


  # **web-scale (adj.)**

  Term for a computing architectural approach introduced by Gartner in 2013\. Not just "big" or "enterprise," but includes high agility and performance at massive scale‚Äîup to millions of users‚Äîfollowing the best practices used by large, established, cloud-based firms like Google, Amazon, and Facebook for better service delivery, including:  

* Cloud-based, integrated datacenters

  * Separate, integrated compute and storage

  * Distributed data and services

  * Software-based abstraction

# Editor guide (for Word Nerds)

Formatting: 

* **Headers:** Use the default Header 1 text styling for entry titles (selected next to the font). For subheads, use bold body copy formatting.

* **Body copy:** 

  * Use Red Hat Text (Normal) size 12 and ‚ÄúAdd space after paragraph‚Äù selected.   
  * Do not include line spacing after list items unless for readability (long lists with multiline entries)

* **Tables:** Use body copy styling, with bold text for header row text and \#9ad8d8 for header row background fill color. Remove space after paragraph unless table cell includes multiple paragraphs.

* **Links:** Use body copy styling with default link color (blue).

  * If you are cross-linking to an existing entry, use the suggested header (TT) link, not the bookmark link.

  If you are pasting content from an existing draft, website, etc., use "Paste without formatting‚Äù and adjust font size/spacing to match formatting specified above.

  After you‚Äôve added the new header and body copy:

* Use Insert \> Bookmark for the entry header to create a direct (shareable) link to the entry.  
* Update the changelog to include a summary of the change (new entry or summary of existing entry updates).  
* Update the date in the title of the style guide.
